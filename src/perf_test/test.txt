(--)-alpha-Bisabolol has a primary antipeptic action depending on dosage, which is not caused by an alteration of the pH-value.
The proteolytic activity of pepsin is reduced by 50 percent through addition of bisabolol in the ratio of 1/0.5.
In case of a previous contact with the substrate, the inhibiting effect is lost.
A report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in BA 1 [N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea] having a (low) molecular mass M = 111.104.
Experiments in 214 DS carcinosarcoma bearing Wistar rats have shown that BA 1, at a dosage of only about 12 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) and negligible lethality (1.7 percent), results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia and, in one test, of 80 percent with hyperglycemia.
Under otherwise unchanged conditions the reference substance ifosfamide (IF) -- a further development of cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of 47 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at a lethality of 18 percent.
(Contrary to BA 1, 250-min hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the recovery rate.)
However this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different (complementary) mechanisms of action.
Leucocyte counts made after application of the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with BA 1 and with ifosfamide, the known suppression in the post-therapeutic interval usually found with standard cancerostatics.
In combination with the cited plaque test for BA 1, blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status.
Since IF can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostatics--there is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the DS carcinosarcoma in rats -- these findings are of special importance.
Finally, the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of tumour-free rats after i.v.
The distribution of blood flow to the subendocardial, medium and subepicardial layers of the left ventricular free wall was studied in anaesthetized dogs under normoxic (A), hypoxic (B) conditions and under pharmacologically induced (etafenone) coronary vasodilation (C).
Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by means of the particle distribution method.
In normoxia a transmural gradient of flow was observed, with the subendocardial layers receiving a significantly higher flow rate compared with the subepicardial layers.
In hypoxia induced vasodilation this transmural gradient of flow was persistent.
In contrast a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically induced vasodilation.
In contrast to some findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable vasodilatory capacity exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs.
The differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism.
The virostatic compound N,N-diethyl-4-[2-(2-oxo-3-tetradecyl-1-imidazolidinyl)-ethyl]-1-piperazinecarboxamide-hydrochloride (5531) was analyzed as to its effect on the induction of tryptophan-pyrrolase and tyrosineaminotransferase in rat liver.
The basic activity of the enzymes was not influenced by the substance either in normal or in adrenalectomized animals.
The induction of the enzymes by cortisone increased in the presence of the compound whereas the substrate induction remained unchanged.
The induction of tyrosine-aminotransferase by dexamethasonephosphate in tissue culture is inhibited if the dose of compound 5531 is higher than 5 mug/ml.
The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone.
The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed.
Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD.
As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity.
They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than CPZ.
We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us.
As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition.
Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.)
Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are similar to CPZ, although with less effect on dopamine level.
A double-blind study with intra-individual comparisons was carried out to investigate the effects of 15 mg of (8r)-3alpha-hydroxy-8-isopropyl-1alphaH-tropanium bromide(+/-)-tropate (Sch 1000), 15 mg Sch 1000 + 10 mg oxazepam, 10 mg oxazepam and placebo with oral administration in randomized sequence on gastric juice volume, amount of acid, concentration and pH values in 12 healthy volunteers.
The gastric juice was obtained in 15 min portions via stomach tube.
Stimulation was effected by 1 mug/kg/h pentagastrin via drip infusion.
The Friedman test was used for the comparative statistical evaluation, and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the Wilcoxon test (pair-differences rank).
The results show that Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume.
As compared with placebo, it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone.
Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid, while oxazepam reduced this quantity only during the first 30 min of basal secretion.
None of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid, although both Sch 1000 preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values.
During the basal secretion period, all three test preparations had an inhibiting action on acid concentration, but none of them had a significant effect during the stimulation period.
The pH value was savely increased only by Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam, and this even only during the basal period.
Seven distinct glycosidases (EC 3.2) have been characterized in guinea-pig epidermis.
The 'profile' of the epidermal glycosidases is significantly different from that reported for whole skin, the activities of beta-galactosidase and beta-acetylglucosaminidase being very high and those of the remaining enzymes relatively low in epidermis.
Five distinct ester hydrolases (EC 3-1) have been characterized in guinea-pig epidermis.
These are carboxylic esterase, acid phosphatase, pyrophosphatase, and arylsulphatase A and B.
A serum agglutinin reactive with red cells in the presence of polycarboxyl groups is reported.
It is likely that this represents an additional example of the type of agglutinin previously described as agglutinating red cells in the absence of ionized calcium.
Experimental evidence is presented indicating that it is free polycarboxyl groups that potentiate agglutination and that any metal ion, such as calcium, capable of chelating with these groups will prove to be inhibitory.
Stroma from either normal or PNH-like red cells is capable of inhibiting, to some extent, lysis in the sucrose test and enhancing lysis in the acidified-serum test.
The same opposing effects are displayed by the exclusion peaks from Sephadex G-200 obtained from each stroma preparation, suggesting that the same factor could be responsible for both activities.
Stromata and peaks also induce lysis of PNH-like cells in unacidified serum, indicating activation of complement through the alternate pathway.
This is confirmed by immunoelectrophoretic observation.
When serum previously activated through the alternate pathway is used in the sucrose test the amount of lysis is markedly reduced.
This would indicate that the classical pathway activation can be controlled by the alternate pathway.
The possible clinical significance of these factors in determining the haemolytic crisis in PNH patients is discussed.
The effect of the major metabolite of aspirin, namely salicylic acid, upon the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of normal and G6PD-deficient red cells has been studied.
Salicylic acid was shown to inhibit this pathway in proportion to the amount present.
At any concentration of this substance there was greater inhibition of the PPP in G6PD-deficient than in normal red cells.
In one experiment the effect on rumen pH of feeding with restricted amounts of whole or pelleted barley was studied.
With whole barley there was little variation in rumen pH associated with feeding time, but with pelleted barley the pH decreased from about 7-0 before feeding to about 5-3, 2--3 h after feeding.
The rate of disappearance of dried grass during incubation in the rumens of sheep receiving either whole or pelleted barley was studied in a second experiment.
After 24 h incubation only 423 mg/g incubated had disappeared in the rumen of sheep receiving pelleted barley while 625 mg/g incubated had disappeared when it was incubated in the rumen of sheep receiving whole barley.
The voluntary intake of dried grass of lambs was studied in a third experiment when they received supplements of either 25 or 50 g whole or pelleted barley/kg live weight 0-75.
At the high level, pelleted barley reduced intake of dried grass by 534 g/kg but whole barley reduced it by only 352 g/kg.
The digestibility of acid-detergent fibre was reduced more by pelleted barley than by whole barley but there was a tendency for a small increase in digestibility of the barley due to processing.
Poly(8-aminoguanylic acid) has in neutral solution a novel ordered structure of high stability.
The 8-amino group permits formation of three hydrogen bonds between two residues along the "top", or long axis, of the purines.
The usual hydrogen bonding protons and Watson-Crick pairing sites are not involved in the association.
The bonding scheme has a twofold rotation axis and is hemiprotonated at N(7).
Poly(8NH2G) is converted by alkaline titration (pK = 9.7) to a quite different ordered structure, which is the favored form over the range approximately pH 10-11.
The bonding scheme appears to be composed of a planar, tetrameric array of guanine residues, in which the 8-amino group does not participate in interbase hydrogen bonding.
Poly (8NH2G) does not interact with poly(C) in neutral solution because of the high stability of the hemiprotonated G-G self-structure.
Titration to the alkaline plateau, however, permits ready formation of a two-stranded Watson-Crick helix.
In contrast to the monomer 8NH2GMP, poly(8NH2G) does not form a triple helix with poly(C) under any conditions.
The properties of the ordered structures are interpreted in terms of a strong tendency of the 8-amino group to form a third interbase hydrogen bond, when this possibility is not prevented by high pH.
The presence of at least two ionizable active center groups has been detected by a study of the effect of pH upon catalysis of hydrolysis of L-alanyl-beta-naphthylamide by human liver alanine aminopeptidase and upon the inhibition of hydrolysis by inhibitors and substrate analogs.
L-Phe was previously shown to bind the active center since it was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of tripeptide substrates (Garner, C. W., and Behal, F. J.
A plot of pKm vs. pH for the substrate L-Ala-beta-naphthylamide showed that binding decreased below pH 5.9 and above 7.5, the points at which the theoretical curve undergoes an integral change in slope.
These points are interpreted as the pKa either of substrate ionizable groups or binding-dependent enzyme active center groups.
Similar plots of pKm vs. pH for L-alanyl-p-nitroanilide (as substrate) and pKi vs. pH for L-Leu-L-Leu-L-Leu and D-Leu-L-Tyr (as inhibitors) gave pairs fo pKa values of 5.8 and 7.4, 6.0 and 7.5, and 5.7 and 7.5, respectively.
All the above substrates (and D-Leu-L-Tyr) have pKa values near 7.5; therefore, the binding-dependent group with a pKa value near 7.5 is possibly this substrate group.
Similar plots of pKi vs. pH for the inhibitors L-Phe, L-Met, L-Leu, octylamine, and octanoic acid had only one bending point at 7.7, 7.6, 7.4, 6.3, and 5.9, respectively.
Amino acid inhibitors, octylamine, and octanoic acid have no groups with pKa values between 5 and 9.
These data indicate that there are two active center ionizable groups with pKa values of approximately 6.0 and 7.5 which are involved in substrate binding or inhibitory amino acid binding but not in catalysis since Vmax was constant at all pH values tested.
The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with NAD+ and NADP+ has been studied with stopped-flow techniques.
The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme.
The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-NAD(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-NAD(P)H-gl).
The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra.
The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl).
The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex.
The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50% greater than those with NADP+.
Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with NADP+ as coenzyme.
ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) formation.
The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added.
The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the ADP activating site of the enzyme.
Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.
Choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes the biosynthesis of acetylcholine according to the following chemical equation: acetyl-CoA + choline in equilibrium to acetylcholine + CoA.
In addition to nervous tissue, primate placenta is the only other animal source which contains appreciable acetylcholine and its biosynthetic enzyme.
Human brain caudate nucleus and human placental choline acetyltransferase were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using ion-exchange and blue dextran-Sepharose affinity chromatography.
The molecular weights determined by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis are 67000 plus or minus 3000.
N-Ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inhibit the enzyme.
The pKa of the group associated with N-ethylmaleimide inhibition is 8.6 plus or minus 0.3.
A chemically competent acetyl-thioenzyme is isolable by Sephadex gel filtration.
The enzymes from the brain and placenta are thus far physically and biochemically indistinguishable.
Increasing concentrations of chloride were found to increase the resolution between two visible absorbance spectral transitions associated with acidification of ferricytochrome c. Analysis of a variety of spectral and viscosity measurements indicates that protonation of a single group having an apparent pK of 2.1 +/- 0.2 and an intrinsic pK of about 5.3 displaces the methionine ligand without significantly perturbing the native globular conformation.
Analysis of methylated ferricytochrome c suggests that protonation of a carboxylate ion, most likely a heme propionate residue, is responsible for displacement of the methionine ligand.
Addition of a proton to a second group having an apparent pK of 1.2 +/- 0.1 displaces the histidine ligand and unfolds the protein from a globular conformation into a random coil.
It is most likely that the second protonation occurs on the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand itself.
Chloride is proposed to perturb these transitions by ligation in the fifth coordination position of the heme ion.
Such ligation stabilizes a globular conformation of ferricytochrome c at pH 0.0 and 25 degrees.
The properties of the functional groups in a protein can be used as built-in-probes of the structure of the protein.
The method may be applied to the side chain of histidine, tyrosine, lysine, and cysteine, as well as to the amino terminus of the protein.
The method, which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using [3H]- and [14C]1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (N2ph-F) in a double-labeling procedure, is rapid and sensitive.
Advantage is taken of the fact that after acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein, a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein.
The method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme, alpha-lytic protease, and Streptomyces griseus (S.G.) trypsin, as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein.
The following parameters were obtained for reaction with N2ph-F at 20 degrees C in 0.1 N KCl: the histidine of hen egg-white lysozyme, pKa of 6.4 and second-order velocity constant of 0.188 M-1 min-1; the histidine of alpha-lytic protease, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0235 M-1 min-1; the histidine of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0328 M-1 min-1; the valyl amino terminus of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 8.1 and second-order velocity constant of 0.403 M-1 min-1.
In addition, the results obtained provide clues as to the microenvironments of these functional groups, and indicate that the proteins studied undergo pH-dependent conformational changes which affect the microenvironment, and hence the chemical reactivity of these groups.
Primary amines react with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 6-9 to form enamines, N-alkyl-4-amino-3-penten-2-ones.
The latter compounds readily regenerate the primary amine at low pH or on treatment with hydroxylamine.
Guanidine and substituted guanidines react with 2,4-pentanedione to form N-substituted 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidines at a rate which is lower by at least a factor of 20 than the rate of reaction of 2,4-pentanedione with primary amines.
Selective modification of lysine and arginine side chains in proteins can readily be achieved with 2,4-pentanedione.
Modification of lysine is favored by reaction at pH 7 or for short reaction times at pH 9.
Selective modification of arginine is achieved by reaction with 2,4-pentanedione for long times at pH 9, followed by treatment of the protein with hydroxylamine.
The extent of modification of lysine and arginine side chains can readily be measured spectrophotometrically.
Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 7 results in modification of 3.8 lysine residues and less than 0.4 arginine residue in 24 hr.
Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 9 results in modification of 4 lysine residues and 4.5 arginine residues in 100 hr.
Treatment of this modified protein with hydroxylamine regenerated the modified lysine residues but caused no change in the modified arginine residues.
One arginine residue seems to be essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
Above pH 8.5, pepsinogen is converted into a form which cannot be activated to pepsin on exposure to low pH.
Intermediate exposure to neutral pH, however, returns the protein to a form which can be activated.
Evidence is presented for a reversible, small conformational change in the molecule, distinct from the unfolding of the protein.
At the same time, the molecule is converted to a form of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low pH, where activation is normally seen.
Titration of the basic NH2-terminal region produced an open form, which can return to the native form at neutral pH, but which is maintained at low pH by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin portion.
A purification procedure is reported for obtaining bovine liver dihydrofolate reductase in high yield and amounts of 100-200 mg. A key step in the procedure is the use of an affinity gel prepared by coupling pteroyl-L-lysine to Sepharose.
The purified reductase has a specific activity of about 100 units/mg and is homogeneous as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and titration with methotrexate.
The reductase has a molecular weight of about 21500 on the basis of amino acid composition and 22100 +/- 300 from equilibrium sedimentation.
It is not inhibited by antiserum to the Streptococcus faecium reductase (isoenzyme 2).
Unlike the reductase of many other vertebrate tissues, the bovine enzyme is inhibited by mercurials rather than activated and it has a single pH optimum at both low and high ionic strength.
However, the position of the pH optimum is shifted and the activity increased by increasing ionic strength.
Automatic Edman degradation has been used to determine 34 of the amino-terminal 37 amino acid residues.
Considerable homology exists between this region and the corresponding regions of the reductase from S. faecium and from Escherichia coli.
Dihydrofolate reductase has been purified 40-fold to apparent homogeneity from a trimethoprim-resistant strain of Escherichia coli (RT 500) using a procedure that includes methotrexate affinity column chromatography.
Determinations of the molecular weight of the enzyme based on its amino acid composition, sedimentation velocity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis gave values of 17680, 17470 and 18300, respectively.
An aggregated form of the enzyme with a low specific activity can be separated from the monomer by gel filtration; treatment of the aggregate with mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol results in an increase in enzymic activity and a regeneration of the monomer.
Also, multiple molecular forms of the monomer have been detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
The unresolved enzyme exhibits two pH optima (pH 4.5 and pH 7.0) with dihydrofolate as a substrate.
In 100 mM imidazolium chloride (pH 7), the specific activity is 47 mumol of dihydrofolate reduced per min per mg at 30 degrees.
Folic acid also serves as a substrate with a single pH optimum of pH 4.5.
At this pH the Km for folate is 16 muM, and the Vmax is 1/1000 of the rate observed with dihydrofolate as the substrate.
Monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) inhibit dihydrofolate reductase; at a given ionic strength the degree of inhibition is a function of the ionic radius of the cation.
Divalent cations are more potent inhibitors; the I50 of BaCl2 is 250 muM, as compared to 125 mM for KCl.
Ionization effects on the binding of the potential transition state analogues 2-phosphoglycolate and 2-phosphoglycolohydroxamate appear to be attributable to the changing state of ionization of the ligands themselves, therefore it is unnecessary to postulate the additional involvement of an ionizing residue at the active site of triosephosphate isomerase to explain the influence of changing pH on Ki in the neutral range.
The binding of the competitive inhibitor inorganic sulfate is insensitive to changing pH in the neutral range.
3-Chloroacetol sulfate, synthesized as an active-site-specific reagent for triosephosphate isomerase, is used to provide an indication of the pKa of the essential carboxyl group of this enzyme.
Previously described active-site-specific reagents for the isomerase were phosphate esters, and their changing state of ionization (accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the active site) may have complicated earlier attempts to determine the pKa of the essential carboxyl group from the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation.
Being a strong monoprotic acid, chloroacetol sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pKa of the carboxyl group.
Chloroacetol sulfate inactivates triosephosphate isomerase by the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier.
From the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation of yeast triosephosphate isomerase, the apparent pKa of the active-site carboxyl group is estimated as 3.9 +/- 0.1.
Kinetic analyses of monoanion inhibition and 15Cl nuclear magnetic resonance at 5.88 MHz were employed to study monoanion interactions with the zinc metalloenzyme, renal dipeptidase.
The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of glycyldehydrophenylalanine exhibited competitive inhibition when the reaction rate was determined in the presence of the monovalent anions fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, nitrate, or thiocyanate or upon the addition of the divalent anion, sulfate.
Competitive inhibition was produced by these anions.
One anion was bound per enzyme molecule, and except in the case of fluoride all of the anions appeared to bind at the same site.
Cyanide ion produced a much more effective inhibition of renal dipeptidase than the other monoanions, and it was shown that two cyanide ions were bound per enzyme molecule.
An investigation of the effect of pH upon monoanion inhibition suggested that the anion inhibitors bind to the group with a pK of approximately 7.8.
Complete dissociation of this group (approximately pH 8.4) eliminates the inhibitory effect of anions.
The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase in 0.5 M NaCl solutions was 100 times more effective than that produced by equivalent concentrations of aquozinc(II).
The line broadening was dependent upon the concentration of the metalloenzyme and independent of the frequency of the exciting radiation.
When zinc ion was removed from the metalloenzyme by dialysis or when chloride was titrated from the metalloenzyme by cyanide, line broadening was decreased.
The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase was shown to decrease with increasing pH through the range pH 5.8-10.8.
This line-width variation with pH appeared to result from the titration of a site on the metalloprotein with an approximate pK of 7.4.
Temperature studies of 35Cl line broadening by the metalloenzyme in the presence of chloride and cyanide inhibitors suggest that the fast exchange process pertains and that the dominant relaxation mechanism is quadrupolar in nature.
Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase was slowly and irreversibly inactivated by hydrogen peroxide.
The rate of this inactivation was directly dependent upon the concentrations of both H2O2 and of enzyme, and its second-order rate constant at pH 10.0 and 25 degrees was 6.7 M-1 sec-1.
Inactivation was preceded by a bleaching due to rapid reduction of Cu2+ on the enzyme, and following this there was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region, which was coincident with the loss of catalytic activity.
Inactivation of the enzyme was pH-dependent and indicated an essential ionization whose pKa was approximately 10.2.
Replacement of H2O by D2O raised this pKa but did not diminish the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase, measured at pH 10.0.
Alcohols and benzoate, which scavenge hydroxyl radical, did not protect.
The data were interpreted in terms of the reduction of the enzyme-bound Cu2+ to Cu+, by H2O2, followed by a Fenton's type reaction of the Cu+ with additional H2O2.
This would generate Cu2+-OH- or its ionized equivalent, Cu2+-O--, which could then oxidatively attack an adjacent histidine and thus inactivate the enzyme.
Compounds which protected the enzyme could have done so by reacting with the bound oxidant, in competition with the adjacent histidine.
The near-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) of three homogeneous anti-type III pneumococcal antibodies in the absence and the presence of the specific hexasaccharide ligand was studied.
In addition recombinations and hybridizations of H and L chains derived from two of these antibodies were carried out and the CD spectra of bound and free reconstituted IgG molecules were measured.
The results indicate that the CD spectra of the native antibodies in the 260-310-nm range are very similar in shape and sign and exhibit a positive band at 285 nm.
The homologous reconstituted antibody molecules exhibited CD spectra very similar in shape and sign to those of the native antibody molecules although recombinant molecules are no longer stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds.
Upon addition of the hexasaccharide ligand, a significant decrease in amplitude of the CD spectra (18-21%) occurred in all three native antibodies and their Fab fragments as well as in the homologous recombinant molecules.
No CD spectral changes could be detected upon interaction of the hapten ligand with the heterologous recombinants.
All homogeneous antibodies studied exhibited fluorescence quenching upon oligosaccharide binding and a blue shift of the emission maximum.
This property allowed the determination of the binding constant of one selected antibody to be made.
Taken together, CD and fluorescence spectroscopic data suggest that oligosaccharide ligands induced detectable conformational changes in the Fab fragment of the antibody.
The circular polarization of luminescence (CPL) emitted by tryptophan residues was used as a sensitive probe for measuring ligand-induced structural changes in a homogeneous type III pneumococcal antibody.
A series of oligosaccharide ligands of increasing size derived from type III polysaccharide by partial acid hydrolysis was assayed.
Ligand-induced changes in the circular polarization of fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested, including tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides and a 16-residue oligomer, the largest changes being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type III pneumococcal (SIII) polysaccharide.
When Fab' or F(ab')2 fragments were used instead of the antibody IgG for binding of SIII polysaccharide, the extent of conformational changes was decreased.
This suggests interactions between Fab and Fc portions in the IgG molecule and subsequent conformational changes in Fc part upon antigen binding.
Reduction of interchain disulfide bonds abolished the additional spectral changes attributed to the Fc part but not the changes observed in the Fab part, thus suggesting that the presence of the interchain disulfide bond in the hinge region is required for maximal CPL changes to occur.
Small monovalent ligands, i.e., the tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides, were capable of inducing CPL changes in the Fab part of the antibody molecule as well as CPL changes attributed to the Fc portion.
A multivalent ligand containing about 16 sugar residues appears to be the minimal antigenic size required for triggering conformational changes attributed to the Fc part, similar to those seen in the interaction with the whole polysaccharide antigen.
The functional role of the Bacillus stearothermophilus 50S ribosomal protein B-L3 (probably homologous to the Escherichia coli protein L2) was examined by chemical modification.
The complex [B-L3-23S RNA] was photooxidized in the presence of rose bengal and the modified protein incorporated by reconstitution into 50S ribosomal subunits containing all other unmodified components.
Particles containing photooxidized B-L3 are defective in several functional assays, including (1) poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis, (2) peptidyltransferase activity, (3) ability to associate with a [30S-poly(U)-Phe-tRNA] complex, and (4) binding of elongation factor G and GTP.
The rates of loss of the partial functional activities during photooxidation of B-L3 indicate that at least two independent inactivating events are occurring, a faster one, involving oxidation of one or more histidine residues, affecting peptidyltransferase and subunit association activities and a slower one affecting EF-G binding.
Therefore the protein B-L3 has one or more histidine residues which are essential for peptidyltransferase and subunit association, and another residue which is essential for EF-G-GTP binding.
B-L3 may be the ribosomal peptidyltransferase protein, or a part of the active site, and may contribute functional groups to the other active sites as well.
The localization of the previously postulated interface recognition site (IRS) in porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, required for a specific interaction between the enzyme and organized lipid-water interfaces, was investigated by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, by measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence of the unique Trp residue, and by protection experiments against specific tryptic hydrolysis.
Using the enzymically nondegradable substrate analogues: CnH(2n+1)(0-)OOCH2CH2N+(CH3)3-(H,OH), it is shown that the rather hydrophobic N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, viz., Ala-Leu-Trp-Gln-Phe-Arg, is directly involved in the interaction with the lipid-water interface.
At neutral or acidic pH the presence of a salt bridge between the N-terminal alpha-NH3+ group and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces, even in the absence of metal ion.
At alkaline pH, interaction of the enzyme with micellar interfaces requires the presence of Ca2+ (Ba2+) ions.
The action of snake venom phospholipases A2 in intact human erythrocytes was investigated in detail.
The basis phospholipase from Agkistrodon halys blomhifii was found to induce both hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and total cell hemolysis under certain experimental conditions.
The hydrolytic action of the basic enzyme was found to consist of two sequential events: (a) hydrolysis of 70% of the total cell ph osphatidylcholine without any evident hemolysis; and (b) complete hydrolysis of the remaining phosphatidylcholine, followed closely by extensive phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis and finally with onset of hemolysis, attack on the phosphatidylserine.
At pH 7.4 and 10 mM Ca2+ only stage (a) occurred.
However, a slight elevation of the pH of incubation to pH 8.0 and/or inclusion of 40 mM Ca2+ in the reaction mixture caused both events (a) and (b) to occur.
The addition of glucose limited the action of the enzyme to stage (a) under any reaction conditions.
An investigation showed that enzymically induced hemolysis occurred under conditions where the intracellular ATP levels were lowered.
Data are presented which suggest that stage (b) is mediated by in influx of Ca2+ into the cell when the levels of ATP are low.
Other species of erythrocytes, e.g., guinea pig, monkey, pig, and rat, were tested but only those from guinea pig behaved similarly to the human cells.
Pig, monkey, and rat erythrocytes underwent very limited hydrolysis and hemolysis.
It is evident that the use of these phospholipases to probe the localization of phospholipds in erythrocyte membranes must be approached with caution.
The spontaneous inactivation of yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to fit a simple two-state model at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees.
The first step is a relatively rapid dissociation of the tetramer to dimers with the equilibrium largely in favor of the tetramer.
In the absence of NAD+ the dimer inactivates irreversibly.
The apoenzyme is quite stable with a half-life for complete activity loss proportional to the square root of the enzyme concentration.
Perturbances of the protein structure (by pH, ionic strength, and specific salts), which have no effect on the tetrameric state of the molecule, result in an alteration of the cooperativity of NAD+ binding, the reactivity of the active-site sulfhydryl group, and the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
Covalent modification of two of the four active-site sulfhydryl groups has profound effects on the enzymic activity which are mediated by changes in the subunit interactions.
Under normal physiological and equilibrium dialysis conditions the protein is a tetramer.
Equilibrium dialysis studies of NAD+ binding to the enzyme at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees reveal a mixed cooperativity pattern.
A model consistent with these observations and the observed half-of-the-sites reactivity is that of ligand induced sequential conformational changes which are transferred across strongly interacting subunit domains.
The kinetics of the pH-induced dissociation of the 3 X 10(6) mol wt hemoglobin from Lumbricus terrestris (the earthworm) have been studied in a light-scattering stopped-flow apparatus.
The data for CO and oxyhemoglobin are consistent with Hb12 leads to 2Hb6 leads to 12Hb.
Methemoglobin at pH 7 appears to be hexameric and the dissociation is consistent with the model: Hb6 leads to 6Hb.
In a sequential decay scheme for which light-scattering changes are monitored, the relative amounts of rapid and slow phase are determined by the rate constants as well as the molecular weights of intermediate species.
Assignment of the hexameric intermediate is supported by an investigation of the sensitivity of the theoretical kinetic curves to the molecular weights of the intermediates.
This assignment is further supported by the following: (1) the same model will fit the data for oxy- and CO-hemoglobin at all three temperatures (a 24-29-fold variation in rate constants), (2) evidence from electron microscopy shows hexameric forms, and (3) methemoglobin is apparently stable as a hexamer at pH 7.
When CO replaces O2 as the ligand, the dissociation rate increases by a factor of four.
The met is about 20 times faster than the initial oxyhemoglobin dissociation rate, but perhaps more relevant for comparing dissociation of the hexamer, the met rate was respectively 100 times and 500 times faster than that for the assumed hexameric forms of CO- and oxy-hemoglobin.
The reduction of metmyoglobin by the iron(II) complex of trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetate (FeCDTA2-) has been investigated.
The equilibrium constant, measured spectrophotometrically, is 0.21 with a resulting reduction potential of 0.050 V for Mb0.
The rate constant for the reduction is 28 M-1 sec-1 with a deltaH ++ of 13 kcal M-1 and deltaS ++ of -11 eu.
Both CN- and OH- inhibit the reduction because of the relatively low reactivity of cyanometmyoglobin (Mb+CN-) and ionized metmyglobin (Mb+OH-).
The rate constant for the reduction of Mb+CN- by FeCDTA2- is 4.0 X 10(-2) M-1 sec-1 and that for reduction of Mb+OH- is 4.8 M-1 sec-1.
The nitric oxide complex of metmyoglobin is reduced with a rate constant of 10 M-1 sec-1.
A rate constant of 1.45 X 10(2) M-1 sec-1 was calculated for the oxidation of deoxymyoglobin by FeCDTA-, in equilibrium constant and rate constant for reduction.
The purification of axonal membranes of crustaceans was followed by measuring enrichment in [3H]tetrodotoxin binding capacity and in Na+, K+-ATPase activity.
A characteristic of these membranes is their high content of lipids and their low content of protein as compared to other types of plasmatic membranes.
The axonal membrane contains myosin-like, actin-like, tropomyosin-like, and tubulin-like proteins.
It also contains Na+, K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase.
The molecular weights of these two enzymes after solubilization are 280,000 and 270,000, respectively.
The molecular weights of the catalytic subunits are 96,000 for ATPase and 71,000 for acetylcholinesterase.
We confirmed the presence of a nicotine binding component in the axonal membrane of the lobster but we have been unable to find [3H]nicotine binding to crab axonal membranes.
The binding to axonal membranes og of the sodium channel, has been studied in detail.
The dissociation constant for the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to the axonal membrane receptor is 2.9 nM at pH 7.4.
The concentration of the tetrodotoxin receptor in crustacean membranes is about 10 pmol/mg of membrane protein, 7 times less than the acetylcholinesterase, 30 times less than the Na+, K+-ATPase, and 30 times less than the nicotine binding component in the lobster membrane.
A reasonable estimate indicates that approximately only one peptide chain in 1000 constitutes the tetrodotoxin binding part of the sodium channel in the axonal membrane.
Veratridine, which acts selectively on the resting sodium permeability, binds to the phospholipid part of the axonal membrane.
Although tetrodotoxin can repolarize the excitable membrane of a giant axon depolarized by veratridine, veratridine does not affect the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to purified axonal membranes.
Similarly, tetrodotoxin does not affect the binding of [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes.
Scorpion neurotoxin I, a presynaptic toxin which affects both the Na+ and the K+ channels, does not interfere with the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin or [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes.
Tetrodotoxin, veratridine, and scorpion neurotoxin I, which have in common the perturbation of the normal functioning of the sodium channel, act upon three different types of receptor sites.
A new procedure is described for selecting nitrogenase-derepressed mutants based on the method of Brenchley et al.
248, 6122-6128) for isolating histidase-constitutive mutants of a non-N2-fixing bacterium.
Nitrogenase levels of the new mutants in the presence of NH4+ were as high as 100% of the nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of NH4+.
Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 and 29), requiring glutamate for growth, synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively (in the presence of NH4+).
A second class of mutants (strains SK-27 and 37) requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein, as determined immunologically.
A third class of glutamine-requiring, nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 and 26) synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein.
F-prime complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map in a segment of the Klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase.
Since the mutant strains SK-27 and SK-37 produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein, it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine synthetase structural gene.
The superoxide anion radical (O2-) reacts with ferricytochrome c to form ferrocytochrome c. No intermediate complexes are observable.
No reaction could be detected between O2- and ferrocytochrome c. 2.
At 20 degrees C the rate constant for the reaction at pH 4.7 to 6.7 is 1.4-10(6) M-1.
S -1 and as the pH increases above 6.7 the rate constant steadily decreases.
The dependence on pH is the same for tuna heart and horse heart cytochrome c. No reaction could be demonstrated between O2- and the form of cytochrome c which exists above pH approximately 9.2.
The dependence of the rate constant on pH can be explained if cytochrome c has pKs of 7.45 and 9.2, and O2- reacts with the form present below pH 7.45 with k = 1.4-10(6) M-1 - S-1, the form above pH 7.45 with k = 3.0- 10(5) M-1 - S-1, and the form present above pH 9.2 with k = 0.
The reaction has an activation energy of 20 kJ mol-1 and an enthalpy of activation at 25 degrees C of 18 kJ mol-1 both above and below pH 7.45.
It is suggested that O2- may reduce cytochrome c through a track composed of aromatic amino acids, and that little protein rearrangement is required for the formation of the activated complex.
No reduction of ferricytochrome c by HO2 radicals could be demonstrated at pH 1.2-6.2 but at pH 5.3, HO2 radicals oxidize ferrocytochrome c with a rate constant of about 5-10(5)-5-10(6) M-1 - S-1.
After a 500 mus laser flash a 120 mus phase in the decay of delayed fluorescence is visible under a variety of circumstances in spinach chloroplasts and subchloroplast particles enriched in Photosystem II prepared by means of digitonin.
The level of this phase is high in the case of inhibition of oxygen evolution at the donor side of Photosystem II.
Acta 376, 329-344, indicates that their EPR signal IIf which they suppose to be due to Z+, the oxidized first secondary donor of Photosystem II, is well correlated with a large amplitude of our 120 mus phase.
We explain our 120 mus phase by the intrinsic back reaction of the excited reaction center in the presence of Z+, as predicted by Van Gorkom and Donze (1973) Photochem.
The redox state of Z+ is dependent on the internal pH of the thylakoids.
The results on the effect of pH in the mus region are compared with those obtained in the ms region.
Upon illumination the reduction of the primary acceptor was indicated by absorbance changes due to the reduction of a plastoquinone to the semiquinone anion and by a small blue shifts of absorption bands near 545 nm (C550) and 685 nm.
The semiquinone to chlorophyll ratio was between 1/20 and 1/70 in various preparations.
The terminal electron donor in this reaction did not cause large absorbance changes but its oxidized form was revealed by a hitherto unknown electron spin resonance (ESR) signal, which had some properties of the well-known signal II but a linewidth and g-value much nearer to those of signal I.
Upon darkening absorbance and ESR changes decayed together in a cyclic or back reaction which was stimulated by 3-(3,4 dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea.
In addition an ESR signal with 15 to 20 gauss linewidth and a slower dark decay was observed, which may have been caused by a secondary donor.
Crude extracts and partially purified enzyme preparations from potato tubers catalyse, at pH 5-7, the conversion of linoleic acid hydroperoxides to a range of oxygenated fatty acid derivatives.
9-D- and 13-L-hydroperoxide isomers are converted at similar rates to equivalent (isomeric) products.
The major products from the 13-hydroperoxide isomer were identified as the corresponding monohydroxydienoic acid derivative, threo-11-hydroxy-trans12,13-epoxy-octadec-cis9-enoic acid and 9,12,13-trihydroxy-octadec-trans10-enoic acid.
No separation of activities forming the different products was achieved by partial purification of enzyme extracts.
Product formation was unaffected by EDTA, CN-, sulphydryl reagents or glutathione but was reduced by boiling the extracts.
This system is compared with the 9-hydroperoxide-specific enzymic formation of divinyl ether derivatives by potato extracts.
Microsomal phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (phosphatidate phosphatase EC 3.1.3.4) was solubilized and fractionated to yield at least two distinct enzymatically active fractions.
One, denoted FA, was non-specific, had a relatively high Km for phosphatidic acid and was insensitive to inhibition by diacylglycerol.
The second fraction, FB, was specific for phosphatidates, had a low Km, and was inhibited, non-competitively, by diacylglycerol.
FA exhibited a sigmoid substrate-activity curve.
The isolated FB aggregated to particles of about 10(6) in the absence of salts and could be dissociated by the addition of monovalent cations at ionic strength 0.4-0.6 to about 2-10(5) daltons and thereby doubled its activity.
Dissociation was time- and temperature-dependent.
F- was inhibitory.
Divalent ions were not required for the activity of FA or FB and inhibited at concentrations exceeding 1 mM.
Rabbit liver microsomal preparations fortified with 0.1 mM NADPH effectively promote hydroxylation of [3beta-3H]- or [24-14C]allochenodeoxycholic acid or [5alpha,6alpha-3H2]5alpha-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha-diol to their respective 12alpha-hydroxyl derivatives in yields of about 25 or 65% in 60 min.
The requirements for activity of rabbit liver microsomal 12alpha-hydroxylase resemble those of rat liver microsomes.
Of a number of enzyme inhibitors studied only p-chloromercuribenzoate demonstrated a marked ability to inhibit the reaction with either tritiated substrate.
There was no difference in the quantity of product produced from the tritiated acid or the 14C-labeled acid.
No clear sex difference was found in activity of the enzyme, nor was an appreciable difference noted in activity of the enzyme between mature and immature animals.
Properties of the phenobarbital induced cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) have been studied in rat liver.
7-12-Fold higher levels were seen in the cytoplasmic activities after phenobarbital treatment in reactor compared to non-reactor animals with high concentrations of acetaldehyde (18 mM) and propionaldehyde (9 mM).
No difference was found with 0.12 mM acetaldehyde, 2 mM glycolaldehyde, 6 mM formaldehyde or 0.5 mM betaine aldehyde.
The reactor group also had slightly higher activity in the mitochondrial fraction with the high acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde concentrations.
In the microsomal fraction, the activities showed no differences at any substrate concentration.
An induced aldehyde dehydrogenase was purified 70-fold by chromatographic techniques.
It had different molecular and enzymic properties than the main high-Km enzyme normally present in rat liver cytoplasm.
The pI of the induced enzyme was about 7.0 as measured by isoelectric focusing.
It was active with several aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes but not with formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde or D-glyceraldehyde.
The enzyme was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of disulfiram.
Estrone, deoxycorticosterone, progesterone and diethylstilbestrol also affected the enzyme activity.
Enzymes capable of hydrolyzing esters of thiocholine have been assayed in extracts of Solanum melongena L. (eggplant) and Zea Mays L. (corn).
The enzymes from both species are inhibited by the anti-cholinesterases neostigmine, physostigmine, and 284c51 and by AMO-1618, a plant growth retardant and they both have pH optima near pH 8.0.
The enzyme from eggplant is maximally active at a substrate concentration of 0.15 mM acetylthiocholine and is inhibited at higher substrate concentrations.
On the basis of this last property, the magnitude of inhibition by the various inhibitors, and the substrate specificity, we conclude that the enzyme from eggplant, but not that from corn, is a cholinesterase.
The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate by wheat germ acid phosphatase (orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.2) has been investigated in mixtures of aqueous buffers with acetone, dioxane and acetonitrile.
The enzyme was either in free solution or immobilized on a pellicular support which consisted of a porous carbonaceous layer on solid glass beads.
The highest enzyme activity was obtained in acetone and acetonitrile mixed with citrate buffer over a wide range of organic solvent concentration.
In 50% (v/v) acetone both V and Km of the immobilized enzyme were about half of the values in the neat aqueous buffer, but the Ki for inorganic phosphate was unchanged.
In 50% (v/v) mixtures of various solvents and citrate buffers of different pH, the enzymic activity was found to depend on the pH of the aqueous buffer component rather than the pH of the hydro-organic mixture as measured with the glass-calomel electrode.
The relatively high rates of p-nitrophenol liberation in the presence of glucose even at high organic solvent concentrations suggest that transphosphorylation is facilitated at low water activity.
A strain of Bacillus sp (Bacillus R-4) produces a protease and a carbohydrolase both of which have the ability to lyse Rhizopus cell walls.
Of the enzymes, the carbohydrolase has been purified to an ultracentrifugally and electrophoretically homogeneous state, and identified as a chitosanase.
The enzyme was active on glycol chitosan as well as chitosan.
Molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated as 31 000 and isoelectric point as pH 8.30.
The enzyme was most active at pH 5.6 and at 40 degrees C with either Rhizopus cell wall or glycol chitosan as substrate, and was stable over a range of pH 4.5 to 7.5 at 40 degrees C for 3 h. The activity was lost by sulfhydryl reagents and restored by either reduced glutathione of L-cysteine.
An abrupt decrease in viscosity of the reaction mixture suggested an endowise cleavage of chitosan by this enzyme.
Oligosaccharides containing terminal non-reducing alpha(1 leads to 2)-, alpha(1 leads to 3)-, and alpha(1 leads to 6)-linked mannose residues, isolated from human and bovine mannosidosis urines were used as substrates to test the specificities of acidic alpha-mannosidases isolated from human and bovine liver.
The enzymes released all the alpha-linked mannose residues from each oligosaccharide and were most effective on the smallest substrate.
Enzyme A in each case was less active on the oligosaccharides than alpha-mannosidase B2, even though the apparent Km value for the substrates was the same with each enzyme.
The human acidic alpha-mannosidases were also found to be more active on substrates isolated from human rather than bovine mannosidosis urine.
Human alpha-mannosidase C, which has a neutral pH optimum when assayed with a synthetic substrate, did not hydrolyse any of the oligosaccharides at neutral pH, but was found to be active at an acidic pH.
The characterization and localization of a Ca(2+)-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) in the tooth germ of the porcine fetus are reported.
This enzyme, a microsome fraction, is preferentially activated by Ca(2+).
In the presence of 0.5 mM ATP, maximal enzyme activity is obtained at 0.5--1.0 mM CaCl2.
The maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis is approx.
20 mumol per h per mg of protein as the enzyme preparation is used here.
At optimal Ca(2+) concentration, the Mg(2+) has an inhibitory effect.
The enzyme does not require Na+ or/and K+ for activation by Ca(2+).
Other nucleotide triphosphates may serve as the substrate, but V for ATP is the highest.
The Km for ATP is 8.85 - 10(-5) M. The optimal pH for Ca(2+) activation of the enzyme lies around 9.2.
Well known inhibitors of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, mitochondria ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase in the erthrocyte do not inhibit the enzyme.
In the subcellular order the enzyme may be assumed to be localized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum fraction containing cell and Golgi body membrane fragments and in the tissue order in the enamel organ containing an ameloblast layer, stratum intermedium and stellate reticulum.
Purified skeletal muscle myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) has been covalently bound to Sepharose 4B by the cyanogen bromide procedure.
The resulting complex, Sepharose-Myosin, possesses adenosine triphosphatase activity and is relatively stable for long periods of time.
Under optimal binding conditions, approximately 33% of the specific ATPase activity of the bound myosin is retained.
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polypeptides released from denatured Sepharose-Myosin indicates that 85% of the myosin is attached to the agarose beads through the heavy chains and the remainder through the light chains, in agreement with predictions of binding and release based upon either the lysine contents or molecular weights of themyosin subunits.
The adenosine triphosphatase of the immobilized myosin has been investigated under conditions of varying pH, ionic strength, and cation concentration.
The ATPase profiles of immobilized myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin, however subtle differences are found.
The Sepharose-Myosin ATPase is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations in salt concentration and the apparent KM is approximately two-fold higher than that of myosin.
These differences are probably due to chemical modification in the region of the attachment site(s) to the agarose beads and hydration and diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix.
Based on incorporation of radioactively labeled N-ethylmaleimide, the readily reactive thiol groups of isolated myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) from fast, slow and cardiac muscles could be classified into 3 types.
All 3 myosins contain 2 thiol-1, 2 thiol-2 and a variable number of thiol-3 groups per molecule.
Both thiol-1 and thiol-2 groups which are essential for functioning of the K+-stimulated ATPase, are located in the heavy chains in all 3 myosin types.
The variation in the incorporation pattern of N-ethylmaleimide over the 3 thiol group classes under steady-state conditions of Mg(2+) - ATP hydrolysis allowed different conformations of some reaction intermediates to be characterized.
In all 3 types of myosin the hydrolytic cycle of Mg(2+) - ATP was found to be controlled by the same step at 25 degrees C. In all three cases, this rate-limiting step is changed in the same way by lowereing temperature.
Using the chemically determined molecular weights for myosin light chains, their stoichiometry was found on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis to be 1.2 : 2.1 : 0.8 for light chain-1: light chain-2:light chain-3 per molecule of fast myosin, 2.0 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of slow myosin and 1.9 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of cardiac myosin.
This qualitative difference in light subunit composition between the fast and the two types of slow myosin is not reflected in the small variations of the characteristics exhibited by the isolated myosins, but rather seems to be connected with their respective myofibrillar ATPase activities.
The pH dependencies of the apparent Michaelis constant for oxidized glutathione and the apparent turnover number of yeast glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) have been determined at a fixed concentration of 0.1 mM NADPH in the range pH 4.5--8.0.
Between pH 5.5 and 7.6, both of these parameters are relatively constant.
The principal effect of low pH on the kinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the observation of a pH-dependent substrate inhibition by oxidized glutathione at pH less than or equal 7, which is shown to correlate with the binding of oxidized glutathione to the oxidized form of the enzyme.
The catalytic activity of yeast glutathione reductase at pH 5.5 is affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration.
The stability of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C in the absence of bovine serum albumin was studied as a function of sodium acetate concentration.
The results show that activation of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on a reduced form of the enzyme.
In contrast, inhibition of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at high sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on the oxidized form of the enzyme.
The phosphorylated form of liver glycogen phosphorylase (alpha-1,4-glucan : orthophosphate alpha-glucosyl-transferase, EC 2.4.1.1) (phosphorylase a) is active and easily measured while the dephosphorylated form (phosphorylase b), in contrast to the muscle enzyme, has been reported to be essentially inactive even in the presence of AMP.
We have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat liver and studied the characteristics of each.
Phosphorylase b activity can be measured with our assay conditions.
The phosphorylase b we obtained was stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate, and was a substrate for muscle phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate, and was a substrate for liver phosphorylase phosphatase.
Substrate binding to phosphorylase b was poor (KM glycogen = 2.5 mM, glucose-1-P = 250 mM) compared to phosphorylase a (KM glycogen = 1.8 mM, KM glucose-1-P = 0.7 mM).
Liver phosphorylase b was active in the absence of AMP.
However, AMP lowered the KM for glucose-1-P to 80 mM for purified phosphorylase b and to 60 mM for the enzyme in crude extract (Ka = 0.5 mM).
Using appropriate substrate, buffer and AMP concentrations, assay conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and 90% of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts.
Interconversion of the two forms can be demonstrated in vivo (under acute stimulation) and in vitro with little change in total activity.
A decrease in total phosphorylase activity has been observed after prolonged starvation and in diabetes.
Two rabbit erythrocyte casein kinases, GTP:casein kinase I and GTP:casein kinase II, have been purified 29 000- and 47 000-fold, respectively.
Studies employing sucrose density gradient centrifugation indicate that kinase I has a molecular weight of about 9.5 - 10(5) (25 S) and kinase II about 1.4 - 10(6) (32 S).
These enzymes can utilize either ATP or GTP as the phosphoryl donor.
Among various protein substrates examined, these kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of casein greater than 50% dephosphorylated phosvitin congruent to 50% dephosphorylated casein greater than phosvitin.
Histones, protamine and bovine serum albumin are poor phosphoryl acceptors.
Kinetic data indicate that both enzymes are inhibited by high casein substrate concentrations which may be partially relieved by NaCl.
Both phosphotransferases require Mg(2+) for activity and are optimally active at pH 9.0.
The enzymes have apparent Km values of 2.5 - 10(-5) M for GTP, 2 - 10(-5) M for ATP, and 0.4--0.6 mg/ml for casein.
The incorporation of the terminal phosphate of GTP into casein as catalyzed by these enzymes is inhibited to varying degrees by ATP, ITP, ADP, and GDP but not by UTP, CTP, GMP, adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate.
The effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is interesting and suggests that this metabolite may regulate the activity of the casein kinases in the red blood cells.
A purification procedure for creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) from muscle of the monke35--170 muequiv H+/mg protein per min at 30 degrees C and a yield of approx.
Assuming equilibrium kinetics, synergistic binding of substrates at one catalytic site is found for both the forward and back reactions.
Inhibition by small anions is determined in the presence of different combinations of substrates and products.
SO4(2-) inhibits by simple competitive inhibition and probably binds at the site of the transferrable phosphoryl group.
Inhibition by NO3-, NO2-, SCN- and Cl- is more complex and these ions are suggested to mimic the transferrable phosphoryl group in a planar transition-state complex.
These anions stabilize the dead-end complex, enzyme-creatine-MgADP, which lacks the transferable phosphoryl group.
The effects of these anions on the dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate complexes is reported and is in accord with the above hypothesis.
Addition of NO3- or Cl- to the dead-end complex or a substrate equilibrium mixture without anion confers protection.
The essential thiol group is inhibited by iodoacetamide at a rate which is essentially independent of pH over the normal stability range of the enzyme.
Contrary to our previous report this pH independence is not altered by the presence of dead-end complex, creatine plus MgADP, in the presence or absence of anion or in the presence of a substrate equilibrium mixture.
It is  inferred that the 'essential' thiol group of the monkey enzyme has essentially the same properties as that of the rabbit enzyme.
A technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a heterogeneous population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension.
After rat kidneys were perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats, viable, counted cortical cell suspensions were obtained.
Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose resulted in a single peak of esterase activity between 0.20 to 0.25 M NaCl/sodium phosphate buffer.
Subsequent elution yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to kallikrein isolated from rat urine, insofar as pH optimum, effects of inhibitors, bioassay activity and immunological properties were concerned.
Calculated yields were about 70% of the total esterase activity present in the parent cell homogenates.
Recoveries of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell homogenates, the DEAE-cellulose columns, or the eluates from the columns ranged from 83-108% (mean 96%).
Using this technique, it was found that the amount of kallikrein activity present in non-incubated renal cortical cells ranged from 0.6-10(-2) to 4.6 - 10(-2) alpha-N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (Tos-Arg-OMe) esterase units per 10(8) cells.
However, cells incubated in a nutrient medium at 37 degrees C for 3-8 h contained no measurable kallikrein activity, whereas the surrounding medium had kallikrein activity which could be significantly increased by aldosterone and decreased by spironolactone.
The electrochemical behaviour of ferricytochrome c, metmyoglobin and methemoglobin was studied using d.c., a.c. and differential pulse polarography, and controlled potential electrolysis.
The three hemoproteins yield d.c. polarographic steps, and peaks in differential pulse polarograms, the height of which is proportional to concentration.
The charge transfer is influenced by strong adsorption.
The concentration dependence of the a.c. polarograms indicates structural changes in the adsorbed molecules.
The affinity for oxygen and the cooperativity in hemoglobin are not affected by the reaction at the electrode.
Theory is presented relating to the binding of an effector to two states of a protein acceptor coexisting in equilibrium.
The problem is treated in terms of the four possible cases which specify relations between numbers of binding sites and intrinsic binding constants relevant to the acceptor states.
It is shown that a distinction between these cases may be possible on the basis of the form of a plot of unbound effector concentration versus the constituent equilibrium coefficient which may be calculated from the sedimentation coefficient of the protein constituent.
Particularly noteworthy in this respect is the finding that a turning point may exist in this plot for defined conditions with systems in which binding sites are not conserved (and binding affinities are altered) on polymer formation.
The latter type of system is exemplified by studies on methaemoglobin A in 0.25 M sodium acetate, pH 5.4.
In the absence of added organic phosphate effectors, a dimer-tetramer equilibrium operates governed by an association constant of 4.15 +/- 0.06 X 10(3) 1/mol, determined from sedimentation equilibrium results.
Correlation of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium results shows that addition of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) results in its binding to one site on each of the dimeric (alpha beta) and tetrameric (alpha beta)2 species with intrinsic binding constants 1.03-10(3)-1.20-10(3) and 1.1-10(4)-2.1-10(4) 1/mol, respectively.
It is also shown that 2,3-diphosphoglycerate perturbs the dimer-tetramer equilibrium in a similar way to ATP.
Human hemoglobin was spin labeled with 4-isothiocanato-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperdinooxyl, which is known to bind specifically to the N-terminal alpha-amino groups of proteins and slightly to the reactive sulfhydryl groups.
Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis indicated a partially resolved five-line spectrum, suggesting that the label was attached to at least two different binding sites.
The relative motion of the spin at one set of binding sites was restricted regardless of the state of ligation and pH, while the motion at the other site showed dependence on those parameters, e.g.
the spin-labeled N-terminal ends of deoxyhemoglobin have restricted motion at all pH ranges studied, while those of oxyhemoglobin are relatively free to move at the basic pH range, but become more restricted in the acidic pH range.
Holo-superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes has been shown to undergo a reversible structural modification in the pH 3-5 range.
The spectral alterations observed on changing from neutrality to pH 2 were: a slight attenuation of the 680 nm absorbance; the loss of the 450 nm shoulder, apparent in the optical spectrum of the native protein; and a new band appeared at 330 nm.
The circular dichroism at 600 nm was essentially lost while a weak negative band appeared at approx.
380 nm and a positive band at 310 nm.
The EPR spectrum was also modified on changing from the native to the low pH form: A parallel increased from approximately 130 to approximately 150 G, g parallel remained unchanged at approximately 2.27, and gm decreased from approximately 2.09 to approximately 2.08.
High resolution (220 MHz) PMR spectra of holo- and apoproteins revealed that the metals influence the three-dimensional structure of the protein.
PMR studies indicated that at pH 3 the apoprotein existed almost entirely in a random coil form and that it assumed a compact well-ordered structure on returning to neutral pH.
The holoprotein maintained a compact, apparently dimeric, structure even at pH 3.
Hb Köln (beta 98 Val leads to Met) was found to precipitate rapidly during mechanical shaking.
The rate of precipitation of Hb Köln is 5-6 times faster than that of Hb S. The kinetics of precipitation of the patient's hemolysate, which is a mixture of Hb Köln and Hb A, showed a biphasic curve indicating that Hb Köln precipitates independently from Hb A.
The mechanical shaking may be used as a new method for detection and quantitation of hemoglobin Köln and other unstable hemoglobins.
The erythrocruorin of the leech Haemopis grandis possessed an S20,w of 57 S at neutral pH, its isoelectric point at pH 6.0 and exhibited a slightly sigmoid oxygenation curve with n approximately 2.1 and P50 = 11.2 mm at pH 7.4.
A minimum molecular weight of 24000 +/- 1500 per heme group was determined from the iron and heme contents, 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 2.73 +/- 0.14 weight %, respectively.
The subunit composition of the erythrocruorin was investigated using gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate at neutral pH.
Haemopis erythrocruorin dissociated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate into four subunits (1 through 4) possessing molecular weights of about 27000, 23000, 21000 and 13500, respectively.
When the erythrocruorin was reduced with mercaptoethanol prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, three subunits  were observed, possessing molecular weights of about 13000 (I), 16500 (II) and 28000 (III).
Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the isolated subunits 1 through 4 showed that subunit I was provided by subunits 1 and 4, subunit II was provided by subunit 1 and subunit III was provided by both subunit 2 and subunit 3.
Haemopis erythrocruorin thus appeared to consist of at least five different polypeptide chains.
It is likely that not all of the constituent polypeptide chains were associated each with a heme group.
The shape of the Haemopis erythrocruorin observed by electron microscopy appeared to be consistent with the two-tiered hexagonal array characteristic of annelid erythrocruorins and chlorocruorins.
The contractile proteins from arterial smooth muscle are highly soluble, and can be extracted at I = 0.05.
However, they can be precipitated by a prolonged dialysis at pH 6 to give an actomyosin with a high, although variable, actin:myosin ratio.
The sedimentation behavior of this actomyosin at high ionic strength was examined as a function of pH, protein concentration and composition by preparative ultracentrifugation.
It was found that much smooth muscle actomyosin is not dissociated by normally relaxing conditions, and that it sediments at a slower rate than F-actin.
The solubility of the supernatant protein (a myosin-enriched actomyosin) in 0.2 M K Cl (pH 7) depended on the pH during centrifugation.
A lower solubility was associated only with a higher actin concentration in the supernatant, suggesting a dependence on actin repolymerization.
Pure myosin was selectively precipitated from the supernatant by polyethylene glycol-6000, but only when the protein was soluble at low ionic strength.
The solubility of purified myosin was similar to that of myosin from striated muscles.
A relationship between the presence of depolymerized actin and the high solubility of smooth muscle contractile proteins is suggested.
The activities of hybrid dimers of alkaline phosphatase containing two chemically modified subunits have been investigated.
One hybrid species was prepared by dissociation and reconstitution of a mixture of two variants produced by chemical modification of the native enzyme with succinic anhydride and tetranitromethane, respectively.
The succinyl-nitrotyrosyl hybrid was separated from the other members of the hybrid set by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography and then converted to a succinyl-aminotyrosyl hybrid by reduction of the modified tyrosine residues with sodium dithionite.
A comparison of the activities of these two hybrids with the activities of the succinyl, nitrotyrosyl and aminotyrosyl derivatives has shown that either the subunits of alkaline phosphatase function independently or if the subunits turnover alternately in a reciprocating mechanism, then the intrinsic activity of each subunit must be strongly dependent on its partner subunit.
Hb-Manitoba was discovered in 1970 [1] in a Canadian family of British origin.
Recently we observed the same variant in a second family, and found that the oxy-derivative of Hb-Manitoba is slightly unstable at 65 degrees C, dissociates less readily at alkaline pH than does Hb-A, and forms asymmetric hybrids with other hemoglobins which are readily detectable by electrophoresis.
The oxygen affinity was investigated of purified Hb Tak, a human haemoglobin variant with elongated beta-chains.
A very low P50 value was found which was not influenced by the addition of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate.
The n value was 1, indicating non-cooperativity.
The oxygen equilibrium curve of the whole blood haemolysate containing Hbs A and Tak was close to that of Hb A at the top of the curve, while the bottom of the curve greatly deviated from the latter, indicative of small if any interaction between Hb A and Tak during oxygenation.
Fragments of isolated rat liver plasma membrane possess a ribonuclease activity which at pH 7.8 in the presence of 10 mM EDTA can digest polyuridylic acid (poly(U)) and polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) but not polyadenylic acid (poly(A)) and polyguanylic acid (poly(G)).
Under these conditions, the membrane preparation does not degrade native or denatured DNA.
The products of the reaction with poly(U) (10 mM EDTA present) can be separated on DEAE-Sephadex into oligonucleotides of increasing chain length.
Most of the products are di- to hexa-nucleotides which contain terminal 3'-phosphate groups.
When EDTA is not present (pH 7.8 or 8.8) the plasma membrane preparation degrades both poly(A) and poly(U).
With poly(A) the product is all nucleoside while with poly(U) as substrate most of the product is nucleoside, but also some oligonucleotides are produced.
The ribonuclease releases acid soluble products very slowly from high concentrations of poly(U) (mg/ml).
Uridine trinucleotide with and without a terminal 3'-phosphate group is degraded by rat liver plasma membrane.
The trinucleotide diphosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed to nucleoside while the trinucleotide itself is slowly digested and yields intermediate products, including nucleoside.
The (Na+ +K+)-activated, Mg2+-dependent ATPase from rabbit kidney outer medulla was prepared in a partially inactivated, soluble form depleted of endogenous phospholipids, using deoxycholate.
This preparation was reactivated 10 to 50-fold by sonicated liposomes of phosphatidylserine, but not by non-sonicated phosphatidylserine liposomes or sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes.
The reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane preparations of (Na+ +K+)-ATPase in its pH optimum being around 7.0, showing optimal activity at Mg2+:ATP mol ratios of approximately 1 and a Km value for ATP of 0.4 mM.
Arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant pH of 7.0 and an Mg2+: ATP mol ratio of 1:1 showed a discontinuity (sharp change of slope) at 17 degrees C, with activation energy (Ea) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 kcal below it.
A further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees C and the Ea below this was very high (greater than 100 kcal/mol).
Increased Mg2+ concentrations at Mg2+:ATP ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the (Na+ +K+)-ATPase activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots.
The addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially inhibited (Na+ +K+)-ATPase reactivation.
Arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees C and Ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol above and below this temperature respectively.
The ouabain-insensitive Mg2+-ATPase normally showed a linear Arrhenius plot with an Ea of 8 kcal/mol.
The cholesterol-phosphatidylserine mixed liposomes stimulated the Mg2+-ATPase activity, which now also showed a discontinuity at 20 degrees C with, however, an increased value of 14 kcal/mol above this temperature and 6 kcal/mol below.
Kinetic studies showed that cholesterol had no significant effect on the Km values for ATP.
Since both cholesterol and Mg2+ are known to alter the effects of temperature on the fluidity of phospholipids, the above results are discussed in this context.
A preparation of ATPase from the membranes of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, solubilized and more than 95% pure, showed two main bands in analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
They did not correspond to isoenzymes because one band could be converted into the other by exposure to a mildly alkaline pH value.
The conversion was paralleled by changes in molecular weight, circular dichroism and catalytic properties.
Denaturation by pH at 25 degrees C was followed by means of circular dichroism, ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
A large conformational transition took place in the acid range with midpoints at about pH = 3.6 (I = 10(-4) M), 4.3 (I = 0.03 M) and 5.3 (I = 0.1 M).
The transition was irreversible.
Strong aggregation of the protein occurred in this range of pH.
The final product was largely random coil, but even at pH 1.5 dissociation into individual subunits was not complete.
However, partial dissociation took place at pH 5 (I = 0.028 M).
At this pH value the enzyme was inactive, but 20-30% of the activity could be recovered when the pH was returned to 7.5.
In the alkaline region the midpoint of the transition occurred near pH = 11 (I = 0.028 M).
The pK of most of the tyrosine residues of the protein was about 10.9.
The unfolding was irreversible and the protein was soon converted into peptide species with molecular weights lower than those determined for the subunits by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate.
Conventional proteolysis did not account for the transformation.
Protease activity was detected in membranes of human bovine erythrocytes prepared by the conventional procedures which include washing and removal of the  "buffy layer".
The enzyme was extracted by 0.75 M KCNS or (NH4)2SO4 and was activated by 0.4 to 0.5 M of the same salts.
Colored, particulate hide powder-azure, membrane fractions and soluble proteins such as hemoglobin, casein or albumin were susceptible to hydrolysis by the membraneous protease.
Partial purification of the enzyme was accomplished through disc-gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of 0.25% positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide.
An alkaline protease (pH 7.4) with properties similar to those of the erythrocyte enzyme was found in leucocytes.
The similarity between the properties of the leucocytic and erythrocytic proteases and the correlation of the activity in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations, suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating leucocytes are responsible for the activity of membraneous proteases in erythrocytes.
In connection with the modelling of biomembranes regularities of the formation and development of interphase adsorption layers of lysozyme at liquid borders under different conditions and depending on the nature of carbohydrate phase were investigated by the determination of mechanical characteristics of such layers.
The investigations carried out showed that the most solid layers appeared under the conditions which assured the formation of the maximum number of intermolecular bonds (which in a common case is performed with maximum disorderlinesss of the macromolecules which get at the interphase).
The fluorescence probe(4-dimethylaminochalcone; DMH) was noncovalently linked to human serum albumin (HSA).
The variation of pH was due to serum albumin structural changes, which was determined in terms of DMH and HSA fluorescence and CD spectra.
Considerable changes of fluorescence and CD spectra were observed at pH 8 and 10, where there is ionization of two more recently titrated tyrosin residues.
It is assumed that these two tyrosine residues are in binding region and quench the fluorescence of DMH between pH 4 to 8.
Quenching disappears if these residues are ionized (pH greater than 8) or if the protein undergoes the N -F transition (pH less than 4).
The helix to coil transition of poly(L-glutamic acid) was investigated in 0.05 and 0.005 M aqueous potassium chloride solutions by use of potentiometric titration and circular dichroism measurement.
Polymer concentration dependence of the transition was observed in the range from 0.006 to 0.04 monomol/e in 0.005 M KG1 solution.
The polymer concentration dependence can be interpreted by current theories of the transition of charged polypeptides and of titration curves of linear weak polyelectrolytes taking the effect of polymer concentration into consideration.
Results are presented of measuring fibrinogen fluorescence parameters in temperature range of 20-80 degrees C at different pH of the solution.
It was found that the temperature increase from 20 to 40 degrees C for solutions with pH of 4,5-9,3 were not accompanied by the conformational changes of fibrinogen macromolecules.
In the temperature range of 40-50 degrees C for neutral solutions conformational reconstruction of fibrinogen of undenatured character took place.
Temperature increase above 50-55 degrees C brings about significant structural changes of fibrinogen molecule which are of denaturation nature.
Experiments were conducted on cats under nembutal anesthesia; a study was made of pulse activity of bulbar respiratory neurons, electrical activity of the diaphragm and of the intercostal muscles; pO2, pCO2, pH, arterial blood oxygen saturation were determined in combined action of hypoxia and hypercapnia.
When hypoxic gaseous mixture was given for respiration the developing hypocapnia disturbed the discharge rhythmic activity of the respiratory neurons, the respiration acquiring a pathological character of the Cheyne--Stokes type.
After addition to the hypoxic gaseous mixture of 2% CO2 the gaseous composition of the arterial blood approached the initial values; this addition prevented the development of hypercapnia and disturbances of rhythmic discharge activity of the respiratory neurons.
Addition of 5% CO2 to the hypoxic gaseous mixture produced a negative effect: at first it intensified and then depressed the pulse activity of the respiratory neurons, caused metabolic and respiratory acidosis, and promoted asphyxia.
A study was made of the content of nicotinamide coenzymes in the liver and myocardium 24 hours after the administration of 0.5 ml of dichloroethane into the stomach.
In parallel with disturbance of the morphological structure of the liver and of the myocardium, increase in the activity of alanine and aspargic aminotranspherases in the blood serum, dichloroethane reduced the content of nicotinamide coenzymes and deranged the ratio of their oxidized and reduced forms in these organs.
Chronic experiments were conducted on rats and rabbits; a study was made of the effect of carbidine on the conditioned defence reflexes in stimulation of the mesencephalic part of the reticular formation.
Carbidine prevented the depression of the conditioned defence reflexes caused by stimulation of the mesencephalic portion of the reticular formation.
This pointed to its depressive influence on the mentioned structures, and was confirmed by experiments on rabbits in recording changes in biocurrents under conditions of stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation.
It was shown in acute experiments on rats that one hour after an intraperitoneal injection of theophylline (50 mg/kg) there was a decrease in the NAD + NADP content by 19.4%, a tendency to a fall of NAD.H2 + NADP.H2 was expressed, and the total nicotinamide coferment level was reduced.
A tendency to decrease NAD + NADP and the total pyridine nucleotide level was seen after caffeine administration.
The action of catecholamines and methylxanthines was compared.
It was shown that isadrine decreased the NAD + NADP level; adrenaline (25 mkg/kg) increased the content of both the oxidized (by 24%) and of the reduced (by 48%) forms of pyridine nucleotides.
An increase of adrenaline dose to 1000 mkg/kg was accompanied by reduction of the oxidized forms (by 22.2%) and of the total nicotinamide coferment level (by 18%).
Low, but acceptable concentrations of chloride, copper, fluoride, sodium, cadmium, nitrate and phosphate were found.
A few water samples showed higher then recommended levels of arsenic, mercury, zinc and lead.
The mandatory limit for manganese was exceeded in 37% of the waters while 88% exceeded the limit for iron.
The high iron content was generally responsible for the high turbidity found in 45% of the samples.
Statistical evidence suggested that septic tank seepage was partially responsible for nitrate, phosphate, iron and arsenic contamination of shallow water supplies.
Lead concentrations appear to vary according to the plumbing used and the pH of the waters.
This study has investigated the relationship between duodenogastric reflux, gastritis and certain symptoms 6-12 months after three operations for uncomplicated duodenal ulcer.
The operations studied were proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV, 20 cases), truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty (TV+P, 22 cases) and truncal vagotomy and antrectomy (TV+A, 21 cases).
Duodenogastric reflux was assessed both by a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of bilirubin in the gastric aspirate before and after operation.
Incidence and severity of postoperative gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy.
There was a significant correlation between duodenal reflux and histological evidence of both severe superficial gastritis and glandular atrophy (P less than 0-01).
There was also a close association between the degree of reflux and the presence of severe heartburn, epigastric pain and bile vomiting after operation.
The amount of reflux did not differ before operation.
There was significantly less reflux following PGV than after either TV+P (P less than 0-025) or TV+A (P less than 0-001).
The results indicate that an operation which preserves an innervated and intact antrum and pylorus will protect against postoperative duodenogastric reflux, gastritis and symptoms.
A new haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity, beta82 (EF6) lysine leads to threonine (Hb Rahere), was found during the investigation of a patient who was found to have a raised haemoglobin concentration after a routine blood count.
The substitution affects one of the 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate binding sites, resulting in an increased affinity for oxygen, but both the haem-haem interaction and the alkaline Bohr effect are normal in the haemolysate.
This variant had the same mobility as haemoglobin A on electrophoresis at alkaline pH but was detected by measuring the whole blood oxygen affinity; it could be separated from haemoglobin A, however, by electrophoresis in agar at acid pH.
The raised haemoglobin concentration was mainly due to a reduction in plasma volume (a relative polycythaemia) and was associated with a persistently raised white blood count.
This case emphasises the need to measure the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin in all patients with absolute or relative polycythaemia when some obvious cause is not evident.
Endoscopic papillotomy was attempted in 59 patients with extrahepatic obstruction of the biliary duct system and was actually performed in 50 patients.
A special high-frequency diathermy knife was introduced via a duodenoscope into the terminal common bile duct and the roof of the papilla was incised.
In 33 out of 39 patients with choledocholithiasis the stones passed into the duodenum spontaneously or were removed endoscopically.
Papillary stenosis without ductal stones was successfully treated with this method in eight out of 11 patients.
One perforation of the duodenocholedochal junction occurred and was repaired surgically.
Endoscopic papillotomy and stone extraction is a relatively safe and effective method of treating extrahepatic jaundice.
The actions of glycine, GABA, alpha-alanine, beta-alanine and taurine were studied by intracellular recordings from lumbar motoneurons of the isolated spinal cord of the frog.
All amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, a blockade of the antidromic action potential and an increase of membrane conductance.
Furthermore, membrane polarizations occurred, which were always in the same direction as the IPSP.
All these effects indicate a postsynaptic inhibitory action of these amino acids.
When the relative strength of different amino acids was compared, taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency, followed by beta-alanine, alpha-alanine, GABA and glycine.
Interactions with amino acids showed that picrotoxin seletively diminished the postsymaptic actions of GABA, while strychnine reduced the effects of taurine, glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine.
But differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could be detected: the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine compared with glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine.
With regard to these results the importance of taurine and GABA as transmitters of postsynaptic inhibition on motoneurons in the spinal cord of the frog is discussed.
(1) Crude synaptosomal fractions (P2) derived from guinea-pig cerebral cortex were incubated in the presence of 50 mM KCl in a Krebs-glucose medium.
Torpedo marmorata electric organs were stimulated electrically in vivo at 5 pulses/sec for 30 min by electrodes placed on the electric lobe.
Synaptic vesicles were isolated from each source and the phospholipid compositions analysed and compared with vesicles  from unstimulated controls.
(2) Lysophosphatidylcholine was the only lysophosphoglyceride demonstrable in the synaptic vesicles from either source and its low levels did not increase as a result of chemical or electircal stimulation.
In each case there was a close similarity of the phospholipid distributions in the vesicles taken from control and stimulated samples.
(3) Control experiments indicated extensive decreases in the acetylcholine content of the vesicles from the stimulated electric organ and smaller decreases in the acetylcholine content of the synaptic vesicles from stimulated crude synaptosomal fractions.
These fractions were found to respire linearly in the presence of 10 mM glucose and the vesicle fractions were shown to have low levels of contaiminating membranes as judged by marker enzyme analyses.
(4) Crude synaptosomal fractions from guinea-pig cerebral cortex were incubated in a Krebs-glucose medium with labelled fatty acids and [3H]glucose in the presence or absence of 50 mM KCl.
Subsynaptosomal fractionation was carried out and specific radioactivities of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol were determined in fractions D (synaptic vesicles), E (microsomes) and H (disrupted synaptosomes).
The release of neurotransmitter did not significantly enhance the labelling of phospholipids in any of the fractions studied as compared with phospholipids from unstimulated fractions.
This was found after two incubation times and using [14C]oleate, [14C]arachidonate, [3H]palmitate and [3H]glucose.
The effects of acid-base changes on cardiac output during diethyl ether anaesthesia were studied in 25 mongrel dogs prepared by surgically implanting a plastic encased non-ferrous core electromagnetic probe on the ascending aorta.
The findings are: (1) Metabolic acidaemia produced only slight decrease in cardiac output but a more marked fall became evident with decreasing pH(2) Respiratory acidaemia led to a slight rise in cardiac output.
(3) Respiratory alkalaemia decreased cardiac output.
(4) Metabolic alkalaemia also produced a decline in cardiac output.
Many eyes donated for use in corneal grafting are rejected because of signs of autolysis in the donor material.
The purpose of this experimental study was to determine whether hydrocortisone acting as a lysosome membrane stabilizer could prevent or retard autolysis of the corneas under storage, and if so, what was the most efficacious concentration.
Different groups of rabbit corneas were placed in saline as controls or in varying concentrations of hydrocortisone (10(-10) M to 10(-4) M at pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Acid phosphatase released after six hours was measured biochemically.
This enzyme was used as a marker enzyme reflecting lysosomal labilization.
Results showed a significant stabilization of the lysosomal membrane at 4 degrees C as compared to 37 degrees C. A trend towards stabilization of the lysosomal membrane was seen when 10(-8) M concentration of hydrocortisone at 37 degrees C was used, there being no demonstrable stabilization at 4 degrees C.
Mock cerebrospinal fluid (pH 5.37-8.38) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) (0.15-1.5 mg) was injected into the subarachnoid space of the ventral brain stem of exteriorized fetal sheep.
Changes in pH on the ventral surface of the medulla did not stimulate respiratory efforts or induce significant cardiovascular changes.
The respiratory response to DNP injections ranged from no response to prolonged rhythmic ventilation that was independent of the peripheral chemoreceptors or the control arterial pH and blood gas tensions.
This inconsistency suggests an effector site somewhat removed from the immediate surface of the medulla.
The heart rate and blood pressure were not affected.
It is concluded that increased H+ concentration in the extracellular fluid of the fetal ventral medulla does not initiate respiration, and any respiratory response to metabolic inhibitors applied to this area therefore is not attributable to a secondary change in surface pH.
phaseoli, Aspergillus flavus, and Verticillium albo-atrum were placed on washed Difco purified agar discs along with an inorganic salt solution containing various levels of carbon and nitrogen substrates.
These discs were exposed to volatiles from six soils (pH 5.1-8.6).
Fusarium solani macroconidial germination was inhibited mostly by volatiles from soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, 7.0, and 7.5, but high levels of glucose and NH4Cl reversed this inhibition, raising germination to that of no-soil, no-carbon or nitrogen controls.
Conidial germination of A. flavus was inhibited mainly by volatiles from high pH (7.0, 7.8, and 8.6) soils, and increased levels of glucose plus an amino acid mixture nullified this inhibition.
Volatiles from soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, and 7.5 stimulated A. flavus conidial germination.
Assays after the removal of CO2 from the air above soil of pH 5.1 demonstrated that volatiles inhibitory to A. flavus were produced by this soil.
Assays indicated that a KOH-soluble compound was a fungistatic soil volatile to F. solani macroconidial germination.
Conidial germination of V. albo-atrum was markedly stimulated by volatiles in all soils tested, and was not affected by removal of CO2.
Earlier work showed that Escherichia coli contains at least two enzymes which reduce nitrofurazone and other nitrofuran derivatives.
One of these enzymes is lacking in some nitrofurazone-resistant mutant strains.
Unstable metabolites formed during the reduction of nitrofurazone by preparations containing reductases IIa and IIb produce breaks in DNA in vitro.
In vivo experiments with nitrofurazone-resistant strains, which lack reductase II but contain reductases IIa and IIb, demonstrated that lethality, mutation, and DNA breakage are all greatly increased when cultures are incubated under anaerobic conditions, i.e., conditions such that reductase II is active.
These results provide further evidence for the importance of reductive activation of nitrofurazone.
The mixture of polysaccharides in the gelling component of agar (agarose) is hydrolyzed to D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose by a series of hydrolytic enzymes obtained from Pseudomonas atlantica.
The final degradative step in the pathway of agarose decomposition is the hydrolysis of the alpha-linkage in the dissaccharide neoagarobiose yielding D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose.
Pseudomonas atlantica when grown on agar produces two specific enzymes, p-nitrophenyl alpha-galactose hydrolase and neoagarobiose hydrolase.
A glucose-containing mineral medium supplemented with 0.01% yeast extract is described upon which all the species of thermophilic and thermotolerant fungi tested will grow.
Using this solid, supplemented mineral medium, the pH and temperature optima for growth of all strains were measured.
No correlation was found between temperature optimum and pH optimum among members of the group tested.
Significant differences in amylase, beta-glucosidase, and phosphatase activities were observed among four Phytophthora cinnamomi isolates grown in nutrient-amended sterilized soil for 20 days.
Amylase pH optima for the four isolates were within a relatively narrow range; at pH 5.5 each isolate was within 90% of its peak activity.
Isolates SB-216-1, 1-281, and C-39 each exhibited maximal beta-glucosidase activity at pH 5.0 and maximal phosphatase activity at pH 5.0-5.5.
Maximal activity for these two enzymes of isolate A-7725 occurred at pH 3.5.
In timed experiments, isolates 1-281 and A-7725 exhibited greater amylase activities than did the other two isolates.
For beta-glucosidase, greatest activity was observed for SB-216-1; ACTivity of 1-281 was intermediate and least activity was observed for isolates A-7725 and C-39.
Isolates SB-216-1 and 1-281 exhibited greatest phosphatase activities; isolate C-39 was intermediate in activity, and A-7725 was least active.
Results indicate that significant differences exist among the isolates tested and that these differences can be quantitatively measured by the methods described.
An intracellular invertase was induced in cultures of Clostridium pasteurianum utilizing sucrose as its carbon source for growth.
This enzyme synthesis could be repressed by the addition of fructose of a sucrose-growing culture.
In contrast, invertase activity was not affected by the addition of glucose to sucrose-growing cells and this enzyme could be induced in a glucose-metabolizing culture by the addition of sucrose.
This enzyme was purified 10.5-fold over the induced lese, EC 3.2.1.26) by substrate-specificity studies.
Invertase had a pH optimum of 6.5 and an apparent Km of 79.5 mM for sucrose, and required high concentration of potassium phosphate for maximum activity.
Invertase was completely inactivated by a 2-min heat treatment at 60 degrees C. This enzyme was strongly inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (pCMB) and weakly inhibited by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), while cysteine could substantially reverse pCMB) inhibition, suggesting that sulfhydryl group(s) were necessary for invertase activity.
The adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) (EC 3.6.1.3) activity in Azotobacter vinelandii concentrates in the membranous R3 fraction that is directly associated with Azotobacter electron transport function.
Sonically disrupted Azotobacter cells were examined for distribution of ATPase activity and the highest specific activity (and activity units) was consistently found in the particulate R3 membranous fraction which sediments on ultracentrifugation at 144 000 X g for 2 h. When the sonication time interval was increased, the membrane-bound ATPase activity could neither be solubilized nor released into the supernatant fraction.
Optimal ATPase activty occurred at pH 8.0; Mg2+ ion when added to the assay was stimulatory.
Maximal activity always occurred when the Mg2+:ATP stoichiometry was 1:1 on a molar ratio at the 5 mM concentration level.
Sodium and potassium ions had no stimulatory effect.
The membrane-bound ATPase in the R3 fraction was stimulated 12-fold by treatment wiTH TRypsin, and fractionation studies showed that trypsin treatment did not solubilize ATPase activity off the membranous R3 electron transport fraction.
The ATPase was not cold labile and the temperature during the preparation of the R3 fraction had no effect on activity; overnight refrigeration at 4 degrees C, however, resulted in a 25% loss of activity as compared with a 14% loss when the R3 fraction was stored overnight at 25 degrees C. A marked inactivation (although variable, usually about 60%) did occur by overnight freezing (-20 degrees C), and subsequent sonication failed to restore ATPase activity.
This indicates that membrane reaggregation (by freezing) was not responsible for ATPase inactivation.
The property of trypsin activation and that ATPase activity is highest in the R3 electron transport fraction suggests that its probable functional role is in coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation.
Within 2 km of a zinc (Zn) smelter in Palmerton, Pennsylvania, near the Lehigh Water Gap, up to 13.5% Zn by weight has been measured in the O2 horizon of the soil, and up to 8% Zn in the A1 horizon.
The total numbers of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi (measured by dilution plate counts) were greatly reduced in the most severely Zn-contaminated soils compared with control soils.
The reduction of microbial populations may be a partial cause of the decreased rate of litter decomposition at Lehigh Gap.
Growth of most bacteria from control sites was reduced by 100 to 200 muM Zn, most actinomycetes by 100 muM Zn, and most fungi by 100 to 1000 muM Zn in thin-Pablum extract agar (TPab).
All the tested actinomycetes and non-spore-forming bacteria isolated from Zn-contaminated Lehigh Gap soils were Zn-tolerant, growing normally in media containing 600-2000 muM Zn.
Most fungi, regardless of source, were capable of at least 50% of normal growth at 700 muM Zn.
Zinc-tolerant bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi were readily isolated from low-Zn soils, suggesting that selection for Zn tolerance may proceed rapidly.
Acidophilic Mortierella species have been selectively eliminated near the smelter, apparently because of elevated soil pH.
were found only in the high-Zn soils.
alpha-Naphthoflavone activates the aryl hydroxymethyl synthetase of both the microsomal membrane-bound and soluble enzymes of rat liver and rat lung.
(1) The effect of feeding a relatively low-protein diet containing 0.06% DAB for 29 weeks on the activity of DAB-azoreductase, nitroreductase (p-nitrobenzoic acid), N-oxidase (N,N-dimethylaniline), N-demethylase (DAB), cytochrome P-450, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, beta-glucuronidase and arylsulphatase A were studied.
Rapid decreases occurred in the activities of the first six enzymes, reaching minimal values at between 4 and 8 weeks.
Activities then increased in all cases to control or nearly control levels.
This rate of increase was least for cytochrome P-450.
At 4 weeks azoreductase activity with the chemotherapeutic agent CB10-252 (I) as substrate was significantly higher than in control rats.
(2) An investigation was made of the differential effects of dye feeding on some of the enzyme activities in the two major liver lobes and differences were found.
(3) The effect of phenobarbital (PB) pretreatment on the DAB-fed rats was studied at 4-week intervals.
(4) After feeding DAB for 4 weeks the effect of PB and 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) on the activities of DAB-azoreductase, CB10-252-azoreductase and components of the azoreductases-cytochrome P-450, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, the CO-CB10-252-azoreductase was not induced by PB or MC, and CO did not inhibit its reduction.
CO caused a greater relative decrease in the activity of DAB-azoreductase in dye-fed animals and also in animals following PB and MC pretreatment, implying a greater role of  cytochrome P-450 in dye-fed animals.
The system involved in the reduction of 2-[4'-di(2''-bromopropyl) aminophenylazolbenzoic acid (CB10-252), an agent designed for treating primary liver cell cancer, has been demonstrated to be localised mainly in the 108 000 X g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenate.
It is also present in other organs particularly in the spleen.
DAB-azoreductase as shown previously is present almost entirely in the microsomal fraction and is found in high concentration only in liver.
The pH maximum for CB10-252-azoreductase implying the importance of the 2'-carboxyl group in determining substrate specificity.
The use of enzyme inhibitors and other additives showed that CB10-252 WAS NOT AXANTHINE OXIDASE OR DIHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE.
Its activity was not affected by carbon monoxide, phenobarbitone (PB), or 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) pretreatment.
Enhancement of the activity by ferrous ions and FAD indicated that at least part of the reduction system could involve a flavoprotein with FAD as the prosthetic group.
The activity of CB10-252-azoreductase and methylred-azoreductase was reduced by menadione (vitamin K3), cyanide and propylgallate.
A diaphorase preparation from pig heart reduced both CB10-252 and methylred with both NADPH- and NADH-generating systems.
(1) Subcutaneous or intra-abdominal injections of 8 mg of HgCl2/100 g body weight markedly depressed hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity of chicks at 1 h post-injection.
The depression occurred despite the fact that the chicks continued to eat up until the time they were killed.
Under these same conditions, the hepatic activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) was not affected by HgCl2, while the activity of the mitochondrial system of fatty acid elongation was stimulated.
(2) When 2-mercaptoethanol was included in the incubation medium for a highly purified preparation of fatty acid synthetase, 500 muM HgCl2 was required to show definite inhibition of the enzyme.
When 2-mercaptoethanol was omitted, 50 muM HgCl2 was inhibitory and 100 muM HgCl2 abolished enzyme activity.
(3) 2 mM dithiothreitol completely protected the purified fatty acid synthetase preparation from inhibition by 100 muM HgCl2.
When dithiothreitol was added after the addition of enzyme to the mercury-containing medium, protection of the enzyme was not complete.
(4) Dialysis of cytosol fractions from chicks injected with HgCl2 against 500 vol.
of 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM dithiothreitol for 4 h at 4 degrees stimulated the fatty acid synthetase activity of the fractions.
Dialysis of cytosol fractions from noninjected chicks under the same conditions was without effect on fatty acid synthetase activity.
(5) These data support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of HgCl2 administered in vivo on hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity in chicks is mediated through the interaction of mercury with the sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme.
It is confirmed that N. nigricollis venom contains several phospholipases one of these is a basic phospholipase A.
This enzyme is toxic for mice when injected intravenously.
In vitro it reacts on egg yolk lecithin producing lysolecithin and prevents the phenomenon of blood clotting.
An immunological identity has been established between this basic phospholipase and two acidic phospholipases present in the same venom.
We have observed a high and significant mortality in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared to normotensive and hypotensive controls, in the fifth generation.
The hypertensive rats exhibited a high frequency of cerebral haemorrhage and periarteritis nodosa.
The influence of the sympathetic nervous system on the cerebral circulatory response to graded reductions in mean arterial blood pressure was studied in anesthetized baboons.
Cerebral blood flow was measured by the 133Xe clearance method, and arterial blood pressure was decreased by controlled hemorrhage.
In normal baboons, the constancy of cerebral blood flow was maintained until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 65% of the base-line value; thereafter, cerebral blood flow decreased when arterial blood pressure was reduced.
Superior cervical sympathectomy of 2-3 weeks duration did not affect the normal response.
In contrast, both acute surgical sympathectomy (cervical trunk division) and alpha-receptor blockade (1.5 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine) enhanced the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of hemorrhagic hypotension in that cerebral blood flow did not decrease until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 35% of the base-line value.
The results indicate that the sympathetic nervous system is not involved in the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of a fall in arterial blood pressure.
Indeed, the implication is that the sympathicoadrenal discharge accompanying hemorrhagic hypotension is detrimental to, rather than responsible for,  cerebral autoregulation.
An isolated perfused canine lung preparation in which determinants of vascular caliber could be individually controlled was developed.
The relation of pulmonary arterial (Pa), venous (PV), and alveolar (PA) pressures was such that Pa greater than PA greater than PV throughout the whole lung.
The addition of isoprenaline to the perfusate abolished vascular reactivity.
Once stability was reached, vascular cross-sectional area remained acceptably constant for 2.25 hours as judged by normalized conductance.
The influence of perfusate hematocrit, blood gas tensions, and pH on pressure-flow relations was then studied in 15 isolated canine lungs.
The hematocrit-vascular conductance relation was derived at constant perfusion pressure.
Conductance varied linearly with hematocrit over a range of 16.5 to 89.5%.
Mean pulmonary arterial blood gas tensions were: PO2 = 121 mm Hg, PCO2 = 28 mm Hg, and pH = 7.46.
Acute respiratory acidosis (PO2 = 30 mm Hg, PCO2 = 81 mm Hg, pH = 7.17) and lactic acidosis and hypoxemia (PO2 = 32 mm Hg, PCO2 = 21 mm Hg, pH = 6.96) did not significantly alter this relation.
Transformation of the conductance-hematocrit data indicated that hematocrit was the most important determinant of relative apparent viscosity of the blood.
Both acute respiratory and lactic acidosis failed to significantly increase relative viscosity within the range of hematocrit usually found in secondary polycythemia.
The interaction of chemoreflex and pulmonary inflation reflex control of the coronary circulation was examined in conscious dogs by comparing the responses to chemoreflex stimulation (intracarotid injection of nicotine) when ventilation was allowed to increase with those when ventilation was controlled.
When the heart rate was constant, intracarotidly administered nicotine induced an increase in the depth of respiration followed closely by an increase in late diastolic coronary flow from 48 +/- 2 to 106 +/- 8 ml/min and a reduction in late diastolic coronary resistance from 1.62 +/- 0.08 to 0.78 +/- 0.06 mm Hg/ml min-1.
After beta-receptor and cholinergic blockade, a similar coronary dilation in response to nicotine occurred only when ventilation was allowed to increase.
However, when ventilation was controlled, intracarotidly administered nicotine increased coronary resistance after combined beta-receptor and cholinergic blockade.
The reflex coronary dilation was not observed after carotid sinus nerve section or after alpha-receptor blockade.
Thus, nicotine stimulation of the carotid chemoreflex results in a striking coronary dilation that has two components.
The major component of coronary dilation follows an increase in the depth of respiration, and its efferent component appears to involve withdrawal of alpha-adrenergic constrictor tone.
An almost identical period of reflex coronary dilation followed either forced mechanical or spontaneous hyperinflation in the conscious dog.
The rate of coronary blood flow was varied in isolated working rat heart preparations to determine its influence on the rate of glocose utilization, tissue high-energy phosphates, and intracellular pH.
A 60% reduction in coronary blood flow resulted in a 30% reduction in oxygen consumption, an accelerated rate of glusoe utilization, lower tissue levels of high-energy phosphate, and higher tissue levels of lactate and H+.
Ventricular performance deteriorated as reflected by a decrease in heart rate and peak systolic pressure.
Further reductions in coronary blood flow resulted in inhibition of glycolysis, a greater decrease in tissue levels of high-energy phosphates, and higher tissue levels of both lactate and H+.
These changes in glycolytic flux, tissue metabolites, and ventricular performance were proportional to the degree of restriction in coronary blood flow.
The importance of coronary blood flow and washout of the interstitial space in the maintenance of accelerated glycolytic flux in oxygen-deficient hearts is emphasized.
It is concluded that acceleration of ATP production from glycolysis can occur only in the marginally ischemic tissue in the peripheral area of tissue supplied by an occluded artery.
The central area of tissue which receives a low rate of coronary blood flow will have a reduced rate of ATP production due to both a lack of oxygen and an inhibition of glycolysis.
The mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic myocardium were investigated in the isolated, perfused rat heart.
Glycolysis was inhibited at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
The major factors that accounted for the glycolytic inhibition in the ischemic heart compared with the anoxic heart appeared to be higher tissue levels of lactate and H+ in the ischemic tissue.
Increased extracellular pH inhibited glycolysis in anoxic and hypoxic hearts much more readily than it did in aerobic hearts.
However, maintenance of both extracellular and intracellular pH caused only a modest acceleration of glycolysis in ischemic hearts.
Accumulation of tissue lactate and inhibition of glycolysis were directly proportional to the reduction in coronary bloow flow in both anoxic and ischemic hearts.
At intracellular lactate concentrations between 15 and 20 mM, glycolysis was inhibited under both conditions.
Addition of either 10, 20, or 40 mM lactate to the perfusate inhibited glycolysis in aerobic, anoxic, and ischemic hearts.
The effect of lactate did not appear to be mediated through changes in intracellular pH.
It is concluded that accumulation of lactate represents a major factor in the inhibition of glycolysis that develops in ischemic hearts.
This study compared the contractile performance of a canine right atrial trabecula with that of a macroscopically indistinguishable trabecula isolated from the right ventricular apex.
The heart was removed from nine mongrel puppies weighing 6-8 kg and placed in Krebs-Ringer's bicarbonate solution.
The bathing solution contained only 1.25 mmoles of Ca2+ and was bubbled with a 95% O2-5% CO2 gas mixture.
Each atrial trabecula was specially selected from the right atrial appendage.
Histologically, these trabeculae showed a remarkable longitudinal orientation of the fibers.
At Lmax (the length of the muscle at which developed tension was maximum) under identical conditions of temperature, rate of stimulation, ionic milieu, pH, and O2 and CO2 supply, right atrial trabeculae achieved the same developed and total tensions but in a much shorter time than did ventricular trabeculae.
Since Lo (expressed as a fraction of Lmax) was less in atrial muscle than it was in ventribular muscle, we concluded that atrial muscle can be stretched considerably more than can ventricular muscle before optimum length is reached.
At any given initial muscle length, the maximum of tension rise for atrial trabeculae amounted to at least twice that for ventricular trabeculae.
At any given load up to 1.5 g/mm2, the maximum velocity of shortening of an atrial trabecula was about three to four times that of a ventricular trabecula.
These results collectively indicate that the contractile performance of the right atrial muscle is in many respects superior to that of the right ventricle, at least under the conditions of these experiments.
The lactate dehydrogenase activity of 89 sera from patients suffering myocardial infarction and of 55 sera from patients with hepatocellular damage was assayed under optimal conditions using pyruvate, alpha-oxobutyrate, hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate as substrates.
Activity was also measured with lactate as substrate at different pH values.
Correct differentiations for single ratios ranged from virtually nil for hydroxypyruvate/alpha-oxobutyrate to is greater than 93 per cent for glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate/alpha-oxobutyrate.
This was little improved by the use of multiple ratios involving up to seven separate assays.
The activity ratio of hydroxypyruvate to pyruvate which is consistently greater than unity was found to be inverted in a case of morphine poisoning.
The effective lenear range (fluorescence vs. concentration) in serum is 0.1 to 10.0 mg/liter, regardless of the ratio (by weight) of the two drugs from 1:10 to 10:1.
For determination of either compound, the maximum coefficient of variation was 10%.
In this method, blood is collected in ammonium heparinized microhematocrit tubes and lactate is directly determined in the plasma, separated within 15 min from the erythrocytes.
Lactate is assayed by mixing 10 mul of sample with NAD+ and lactate dehydrogenase in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrazine buffer.
The rate of increase in absorbance of the NADH formed, measured at 340 nm, is proportional to lactate concentration.
The assay is complete in 4 min and absorbance is linearly related to concentration from 0.625 to 15 mmol/liter.
Analytical recoveries of lactate added to plasma averaged 104% (range, 91-116%).
Results compared well for plasma samples analyzed by this method with the CentrifiChem and the Du Pont aca.
High-voltage paper electrophoresis of small samples of serum and urine at pH 6.0 resolves basic and acidic amino acids and separates them from the neutral amino acids.
For separation and identification of the neutral amino acids, the appropriate area of the electrophoretogram is cut out, sewn onto a second sheet of paper, and rerun at pH 1.9.
By this method, amino acids are rapidly resolved.
It is suited for use with special procedures such as oxidation of biological fluid with performic acid and specific staining for confirmation of amino acid identification.
A simple, highly sensitive and reproducible method for the assay of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2-) activity is introduced, using gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide as a substrate and glycylglycine as an acceptor in 50 g/l of polyoxyethylene nonylphenol.
Serum transpeptidase activity was assayed in 1080 healthy adults, the normal mean value being 14.8 mU/ml.
The diagnostic evaluation of the enzyme in various hepatobiliary diseases is also discussed.
There are different types of renal hypertension: hypertension due to parenchymal renal disease, renovascular hypertension, hypertension due to urological disease, hypertension of endstage renal disease.
Treatment has to consider-above all-the possibility of specific, medical or surgical procedures that may cause the underlying condition.
If the underlying disease is not amenable to specific therapy, symptomatic medical treatment to lower blood pressure is indicated: besides control of sodium-intake and body weight antihypertensive drugs are generally indicated.
We use them, alone or in combination, in the following line of order: diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, dihydralazine, reserpine, clonidine, alpha-methyldopa, guanethidine.
Some effects of sodium salicylate upon anaerobic glycolysis have been studied in normal human erythrocytes incubated for up to 6 h at 37 degrees C in autologous sera.
Both glucose consumption and lactate production were stimulated by concentrations of salicylate up to 60 mmol/l but at the highest concentration used (90 mmol/l) an initial stimulus was followed by inhibition of glycolysis.
Losses occurred of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine 5'-phosphate(AMP)at higher concentrations of salicylate and there was a concomitant increase of inorganic phosphate.
Other phosphate esters underwent concentration changes at higher concentrations of salicylate that reflected inadequate concentrations of ATP for glycolysis.
The rates of sodium efflux from, and potassium influx into, erythrocytes were unaffected by the presence of salicylate at concentrations sufficient to stimulate glycolysis.
with 125I labeled fibrinogen, 51Cr labeled platelets and 99mTc labeled albumin, and subjected to successively increasing amounts of i.v.
infused monomethylmethacrylate, doses corresponding to the amounts released into the blood stream following implantation of acrylic cement during total hip replacements did not affect the clotting mechanism, did not cause trapping of platelets and fibrin in the lungs, did not generate fat emboli, and did not cause depression of the arterial oxygen tension or blood pressure.
Monomethylmethacrylate in whole blood was associated with both blood cells and plasma.
We measured the minute ventilation and arterial blood catecholamine concentrations in four normal men standing and at two levels of moderate treadmill exercise breathing 14% oxygen or air.
Minute ventilation was significantly higher during hypoxic exercise than during normoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min.
Arterial plasma noradrenaline during hypoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min was significantly greater than at rest.
Arterial plasma noradrenaline during normoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min was not elevated above the resting concentration.
The results are compatible with the suggestion that increased concentrations of arterial plasma noradrenaline contribute to the hypoxic potentiation of the respiratory response to moderate exercise.
Clinical impressions about the problem of defibrillation during states of acid-base imbalance and hypoxia have been influenced by studies involving the effect of these derangements on the ventricular fibrillation threshold.
Based on body weight, energy requirements for defibrillation in normal dogs were compared to requirements in dogs subjected to commonly encountered acid-base disturbances and severe hypoxemia.
Seventy-five percent of all animals in the study were electrically converted with low-to-moderate levels of energy.
The incidence of spontaneous resumption of circulation following defibrillation was lowest in animals subjected to metabolic acidosis and hypoxia.
The results suggest that pH and blood gas alterations, previously shown to influence the normal ventricular fibrillation threshold, do not significantly affect the normal defibrillation threshold.
A patient with aortitis syndrome had a pleural effusion which subsided but reappeared with an exacerbation of aortitis symptoms while under antituberculosis treatment.
The character of the fluid was that of an exudate, and the glucose concentration was normal.
Clinical and laboratory features of the case suggest that the effusion was part of the aortitis syndrome per se.
At the Department of Plastic Surgery and Burns, Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfalklinik Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim, a skinbank with typed skin has been established.
The storage system consists of deep-freezing at -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen.
The transplantation of HL-A typed skin was evaluated from the clinical and histological point of view.
Due to the effort necessary for such an undertaking this method is critically reviewed.
The apparent isoelectric points (pI) in isoelectric focusing (IF) of human pituitary and amniotic fluid prolactin (hPRL), both non-iodinated and iodinated, were determined.
Unresolved mixtures of pituitary hPRL isohormones E and F, and of at least five isohormones found in amniotic fluid, and plasma hPRL exhibit an average pI value of 6.5 - 6.7.
Transient state pH values observed or previously reported for hPRL components range from pH 5.9 to 6.8 after correction to standard conditions.
At pH 8.1, the major isohormone, hPRL-F, carriers a charge of 2.2 net protons per molecule.
The net charge differences among isohormones E, F and G are compatible with acquisition or loss of single charged groups per 20,000 molecular weight.
This net charge is similar to that of the least prolactin-bioactive major isohormone of human growth hormone (hGH-B), while the hGH with a bioactivity comparable to that of hPRL exhibits a net charge of 3.4 valence units.
The feasibility of using isoelectric focusing for the separation of primate pituitary growth hormone from prolactin and for the characterization of polymorphic forms of these hormones was explored.
In a pH 3--10 gradient, extracts of both human and cynomolgus monkey pituitaries were each resolved into 4 growth hormone components and at least 3 prolactin components, as shown by radioimmunoassay.
In narrower gradients (of 2--3 pH units) greater resolution was achieved; the principal growth hormone components were well separated from the principal prolactin components but there was overlapping of some minor components.
A partially purified human prolactin preparation was found to contain 4 prolactin components, one of which had a prolactin/growth hormone ratio of 760.
Clinical grade human growth hormone was also resolved into at least 5 prolactin and 5 growth hormone components, many of which had higher pI values than those found in pituitary extract.
Under the conditions used, both growth hormone and prolactin were found to be polymorphic with respect to isoelectric point.
Some of the human prolactin components were found to contain less than 0.2% growth hormone by radioimmunoassay.
Monkey growth hormone containing 0.01% prolactin was isolated.
These findings demonstrate that isoelectric focusing is useful for the preparation of both growth hormone and prolactin which are essentially free of one another.
Certain climatic and edaphic conformations in the Bavarian sub-alpine mountains and in the Alps favor above all the development of a land utilization system and farm structures similar to those in the northern part of Scandinavia.
In 1963/64, the years of the highest environmental contamination up to the present, we established in 600 beef samples from the round or shoulder of male and female cattle (mainly Highland cattle) close connections between the 137Cs-contamination of green crop and the long lastnig yearly precipitation quantities, as well as certain relations between the 137Cs-contamination of meat and differences in the feeding and keeping of the animals.
During summer-seasons (April-October), beef of cattle from pastures with heavy rainfall (Alps) was contaiminated by 137Cs up to 15 times more than that of confined animals.
Hereby the rate of 137Cs-contamination in the meat of grazing cattle was nearly proportional to the quantities of precipitation.
When confined cattle were fed on pastures in autumn after harvesting for 2 to 3 weeks, a quick increase of 137Cs-contamination of the meat was caused within this time up to values which in this district were otherwise only observed in grazing cattle.
The lower 137Cs-content in meat of cattle housed during the summer season is due to the more varied fodder, which is at that time less contaminated than green crop.
During the winter season (November to March), the highest contaminations in the meat of confined (Bohemian Forest) or grazing cattle (Alps) was measured when the animals in these districts were almost exclusively fed with fodder from the own farmground or with leafy silage.
The highest contamination was almost regularly noticed in January, February and March, as generally during these months the highly contaminated first cut hay is fed.
Here the meat was often even more contaminated than that of grazing cattle.
After the quick decrease of 137Cs in fallout noticed in the years 1964 and 1965, in 1965/66 a dependance in the 137Cs-contamination of beef on the methods of keeping and feeding could still be observed in only the extreme cases (Alps, Bavarian- and Bohemian Forest); though in general, meat of animals from districts with heavy rainfall was slightly more contaminated than meat of animals from regions with less precipitation.
Both UDP-glucuronyltransferase (GT) and beta-glucuronidase (betaG) were assayed in untreated liver microsomes.
Optimum assay conditions were established with rat liver microsomes using p-nitrophenol (pNP) and its glucuronide (pNPGA) at the pH optima of GT (7.5) and betaG (4.5).
The activities of the two enzymes were compared using microsomes from rats, mice, pigs, cattle and horses, with pNP, pNPGA, and phenolphthalein as substrate, in the presence of various cofactors and inhibitors at pH 7.5 and 4.5.
The two enzymes were also assayed under strictly identical conditions using pNP and pNPGA and rat liver microsomes at pH 7.5 in the presence and absence of UDP-glucuronate disodium (UDPGA), activators (ATP;UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) and inhibitors.
When provided with a functional level of UDPGA, both enzymes proved active under those conditions, and a conjugation-deconjugation interplay was indicated.
The results suggest that conjugation-deconjugation-reconjugation cycles may be operative in the metabolism of drugs in vivo, taking place already at the level of the liver endoplasmic reticulum.
In omnivorous creatures, the diet is acidogenic, especially as a result of the meat content, which gives rise to phosphoric and sulphuric acids, i.e., to metabolic acidosis.
In the short term, metabolic acids are buffered by tissue proteins and bicarbonate (the 'alkali reserve').
In the longer term, acid must be excreted, or neutralized with base which is also generated from the diet, by conversion of dietary amino-nitrogen to ammonia.
The final steps of this process occur in the kidney, which converts circulating glutamine to ammonia, and to carbon products such as glucose and carbon dioxide, by metabolic reactions which adapt during acidosis to generate more ammonia and maintain an increased renal ammonia content.
The complex mechanisms which govern the formation of ammonia, glucose and carbon dioxide from glutamine, involving the reactions of amino acids, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and gluconeogenesis, are reviewed.
Serum, liver and renal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activities were studied in four groups of rabbits: controls, rabbits with obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis, rabbits with obstructive anuria, and animals with combined obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis and obstructive anuria.
Serum GGT was essentially increased in rabbits with obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis, showing peak values in the combined cholestasis + obstructive anuria group, and practically normal values in animals with anuria.
Liver GGT was increased in both cholestasis groups, but the increase was less prominent than the increase in serum GGT and there was no correlation between them.
In both anuric groups renal GGT was reduced, probably as a result of inhibited enzyme synthesis secondary to the altered conditions for adequate renal function.
The results obtained are suggestive of a probable renal involvement in the formation of the serum GGT activity level.
The mechanism responsible for the changes in serum and liver gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) activity was studied in a model of experimental hexachlorobenzene porphyria in rabbits.
Porphyria followed the administration of hexachlorobenzene in doses of 280 mumol - kg-1 body weight, which were given daily through a gastric tube over a 20-day period.
Serum gamma-GT activity and the activities of the lysosomal enzymes beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and alpha-mannosidase were increased, whereas L-aspartate: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase remained unaltered.
There was a considerable increase in liver microsomal protein, gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450, anilinehydroxylase, aminopyrine-demethylase and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase.
In the liver gamma-GT was detected in the microsomes as well as in the cytoplasm where enzymatic activity was higher.
The high correlation coefficient between liver gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450 and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase witnesses a hexachlorobenzene-induced gamma-GT formation in the liver.
A statistically significant correlation between serum and liver gamma-GT activity was also found.
These data strongly suggest that the increase in serum gamma-GT activity may result from the induction of the enzyme in the liver.
15 untrained women were subjected to a walking treadmill test to determine the influence of maximal exercise upon synthesis of erythrocyte 2,3 DPG.
Although there was a 9.8% increase in the 2,3 DPG content following exercise, there was a concomitant 9.4% increase in the hemoglobin level; therefore, when 2,3 DPG is expressed as a ratio to hemoglobin (See Article), there was no significant change as a result of exercise stress.
It was suggested that three additive factors produced during strenuous exercise; decreased pH; increased hemoglobin concentration; and increased CO2 production result in by-product inhibition of 2,3 DPG synthesis.
It is concluded that 2,3 DPG does not provide a physiologic benefit in the adaptation of the oxygen transport system to exercise.
vulgaris) do not catalyse the hydroxylation of p-coumaric acid in the dark unless a reductant (such as ascorbate, NADH or NADPH) is added.
Superoxide dismutase has no effect on this reaction.
This reaction is completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase, but catalase has little effect.
It is proposed that O-2- generated by illuminated chloroplasts is involved in the provision of a reductant to the enzyme phenolase.
35Cl minus-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies indicate that various digests of human hemoglobin with carboxypeptidase A and B, or a combination of the two, may be used for the identification of chloride binding sites.
All the digestion products contain, like hemoglobin itself, at least two classes of binding sites, one of high, the others of low affinity.
The pH dependence of the excess linewidth of the 35Cl minus NMR signal indicates that in the simple digests with either carboxypeptidase A or B, chloride is bound with high affinity at or near His-beta146-Asp-beta94 and at or near Val-alpha1-Arg-alpha141.
The high-affinity sites show, in the case of the simple digests, a strong oxygen linkage which is lost in the forms digested with both carboxypeptidase A and B; this linkage may thus be correlated to the presence of conformational changes.
Organic phosphates, like inositol hexaphosphate, show competition for some of the high-affinity chloride binding sites in hemoglobin and in the simple digests.
This competition is likewise lost in the doubly digested hemoglobins.
The intracellular pH was measured in growing Clostridium pasteurianum with and acid-base equilibrium distribution method.
[14C]Dimethyloxazolidinedione, [14]methylamine and [14C]acetic acid were used as "deltapH-indicators".
During growth the extracellular pH decreased from 7.1 to 5.1; simultaneously the intracellular pH changed from 7.5 to 5.9.
Thus, the intracellular pH was more alkaline than the extracellular pH by 0.4 to 0.8 pH-units.
This pH gradient (interior alkaline) was abolished by the proton conductor carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and the ATPase inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.
The pH gradient could not be demonstrated in cells depleted of an energy substrate.
These results suggest that the pH gradient is formed by an ATPase-driven extrusion of protons from the cells rather than by a Donnan potential.
Growth of the organism was inhibited by low concentrations of both carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (5 muM) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (5 muM).
This finding suggests that the pH gradient is essential for the growing cell as it may be required for substrate accumulation and other types of transport processes.
Membranes of the bacterial form and the stable and unstable L-forms of Proteus mirabilis contain LD and DD-carboxypeptidase.
The DD-carboxypeptidase is inhibited non-competitively by penicillin G. The enzyme of the bacterial form is highly penicillin-sensitive (Ki - 4 X 10(-9) M penicillin G).
Inhibition is only partly reversible by treatment with penicillinase or by dialysis against buffer.
In contrast, the DD-carboxypeptidase of the unstable L-form, grown in the presence of penicillin, is 175-fold less penicillin-sensitive (Ki = 7 X 10(7) M penicillin G).
Inhibition is completely reversed by penicillinase or dialysis.
After inhibition by penicillin and subsequent reactivation the penicillin sensitivity of the bacterial DD-carboxtpeptidase is similar to the sensitivity of the enzyme of the unstable L-form.
The hypothesis is proposed that P. mirabilis contains two DD-carboxypeptidases of different penicillin sensitivity and with different mechanisms of penicillin binding.
Peptidoglycan synthesis in the cell walls of the unstable L-form is probably carried out with the help of only one DD-carboxypeptidase, viz.
the completely reactivatable enzyme with the lower penicillin sensitivity.
NAD kinase was purified from pigeon liver by an improved procedure which included chromatography on phosphocellulose.
The resultant preparation was homogeneous as judged by gel electrophoresis, but electrofocusing gave indications of heterogeneity.
The enzyme appeared to be of molecular weight 270000, and to consist of subunits of molecular weight 34000; it may therefore be an octomer.
Kinetic studies over a wide range of substrate concentrations revealed departures from Michaelis-Menten behaviour with the substrate NAD+; these were interpreted tentatively in terms of negative homotropic interactions between identical binding sites, since thermal and chemical inactivation studies revealed no evidence for more than one type of catalytic site.
The significance of the kinetics and of the type of inhibition produced by NADPH is discussed in terms of the regulation of NAD kinase activity in vivo.
The effect of acid-base alterations was analyzed using isolated rat hearts perfused at constant coronary perfusion pressure, and stimulated to contract at constant rat.
The amount of shortening in the major axis and its derivative were measured to assess myocardial contractility.
In the physiological range studied by us, acidosis depresses and alkalosis increases myocardial contraction.
However acidosis seems to depress contractility more than the enhancement produced by the same change in pH towards the alkalotic side.
When either amount of shortening or max dl/dt was plotted as a function of hydrogen ion acitvity (aH+) a linear correlation was obtained, either with pure 'metabolic' or 'respiratory' acid-base induced alterations (correlation coefficients higher than -.95; P less than .01).
Our findings suggest that in the range studied by us, contraction of the perfused rat heart following acid-base alterations, is a linear function of hydrogen ion activity.
21 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and 24 control patients were studied before and after a protein load (120 g protein per day during one week).
An EEG was recorded and a visual assessment of frequency pattern was performed.
Venous admixture was estimated during hyperoxia.
According to the EEG frequency pattern the patient group with cirrhosis was subdivided into those with EEG slowing after the protein load (n = 7) and those without (n = 14).
The following results were obtained: 1) Resting arterial blood gases did not change in either group.
2) There was a significant increase of the AaD02 (difference between alveolar p02 and peripheral arterial p02) in cirrhotics and controls.
3) The increase in AaD02 was significantly larger in those cirrhotics showing EEG slowing compared to those without EEG - slowing or to the controls.
There was no significant change in those patients who did not show EEG changes or in the controls.
Two main aspects of the in vitro mouse foetal liver cell assay for Erythroid Stimulating Factor (ESF) in human sera have been investigated.
The haem extraction process has been shown to give specific and quantitative recovery of 59Fe labelled haem from haemoglobin thus confirming that the material assayed in human sera is stimulating the synthesis of this protein.
The extraction procedure can be simplified considerably by prior mixing of the reagents without significantly influencing the results.
Several serum constituents (citrate, testosterone, B12, folic acid and iron) have been investigated over a range of concentrations for possible effects on the cultures.
It is concluded that variations in the levels of these factors in sera from treated patients will not produce any significant alterations in the estimated ESF concentrations.
Some derivatives of isoindoline were prepared in order to test their cardiovascular activity.
In white rats both adapted and unadapted to cold, the RQ dynamics during cold exposure, noradrenaline and ganglion blocking agent administration, were studied.
The adapted animals' RQ in thermoneutral conditions was shown to be a little higher than in the control rats; 0.5 mg/kg noradrenaline injections induced a clear RQ decrease in the former and did not influence the latters' RQ.
Cold exposure was followed by a RQ decrease in both.
Ganglion blocking agent administration decreased the RQ in the adapted animals and prevented it from falling in the control those.
Noradrenaline is supposed to be the main but not the only factor activating lipolysis in the cold adapted animals.
A sulfonamide-resistant mutant of pneumococcus, sulr-c, displays a genetic instability, regularly segregating to wild type.
DNA extracts of derivatives of the strain possess transforming activities for both the mutant and wild-type alleles, establishing that the strain is a partial diploid.
The linkage of sulr-c to strr-61, a stable chromosomal marker, was established, thus defining a chromosomal locus for sulr-c. DNA isolated from sulr-c cells transforms two mutant recipient strains at the same low efficiency as it does a wild-type recipient, although the mutant property of these strains makes them capable of integrating classical "low-efficiency" donor markers equally as efficiently as "high efficiency" markers.
Hence sulr-c must have a different basis for its low efficiency than do classical low efficiency point mutations.
We suggest that the DNA in the region of the sulr-c mutation has a structural abnormality which leads both to its frequent segregation during growth and its difficulty in efficiently mediating genetic transformation.
Conditions are described in which the pneumococcal mutant strain sulr-c, resistant to the drug sulfanilamide, gives rise to sensitive segregants resistant to nitrobenzoic acid at a frequency constant with time.
This segregant frequency is markedly enhanced upon exposure of the cells to doses of ultraviolet light or mitomycin C that permit survival of 50% to 90% of the cells.
From the known influences of these three agents on genetic recombination, we propose that a recombination event is necessary in the generation of segregants.--During a period of incubation following treatment with ultraviolet light or mitomycin C, cell division resumes and the original segregant frequency is restored.
Thus potential segregants are either unable to replicate in the absence of selection, or they are under-represented among the cells dividing soon after treatment.--If the sulr-c mutation is introduced into a mutant pneumococcal strain lacking an ATP-dependent exonuclease activity and deficient in recombination with transforming DNA, segregant frequencies are unaffected.
A patient is reported with mast cell infiltration of the small intestine in the absence of the skin involvement characteristic of mast cell disease.
She also had subtotal villous atrophy responsive to a gluten-free diet.
Criteria for diagnosing mast cell disease of the small intestine are proposed.
The literature of small intestinal mast cell disease is reviewed and the relationship to coeliac disease is discussed.
The microflora and pH of gastric contents were determined in breast-fed and in bottle-fed normal infants, in well nourished infants with acute diarrhoea and in infants with chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition.
The last group of infants was reevaluated after recovery from diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition.
A bactericidal pH effect below 2-5 was observed.
Bottle-fed controls had low pH values and low bacterial concentrations, whereas infants with chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition had high pH values and bacterial overgrowth, essentially of Gram-negative bacilli.
After recovery, the only remaining alteration was the frequent isolation of yeast-like fungi in low concentrations.
Infants with acute diarrhoea, except for the isolation more frequently of yeast-like fungi, presented no alterations; this seems to indicate that pH alterations and Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth occurred during the evolution of the disease to a chronic state.
Breast-fed normal infants had hydrogen-ion concentrations similar to those of the chronic diarrhoea group, but without Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth, suggesting that other factors, besides pH, regulate bacterial growth in the gastric contents of these groups of infants.
Adrenaline-induced gastric ulceration was studied in rats.
Adrenaline in high doses caused gastric ulcer, which was completely blocked by pretreatment with alpha-blockers (phenoxybenzamine, dibenamine), but not by pretreatment with propranolol or atropine, nor by vagotomy, hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy.
After successive administration of adrenaline, once daily for 7 days, however, no gastric ulcer was observed.
Recovery from the ulcerogenic action of adrenaline was seen after 4 weeks withdrawal.
Pretreatment with a small dose of adrenaline inhibited the ulcerogenic action of a high dose of adrenaline.
Pretreatment with reserpine, pyrogallol or iproniazid inhibited the action of adrenaline.
It is concluded that adrenaline has a biphasic effect on gastric ulceration, the ulcerogenic action is due to its alpha-action and antiulcerogenic effect is due to development of tachyphylaxis.
Adrenaline and isoproterenol elicited nearly maximal relaxation of the colon even in small doses, whereas increase in the doses caused greater relaxation in the duodenum.
In the colon, these drugs prevented, to a great extent the contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin but in the duodenum were totally ineffective.
Dibenamine and propranolol reduced adrenaline- and isoproterenol-induced relaxation in the duodenum, though propranolol decreased the relaxation caused by isoproterenol.
Atropine prevented ACh-induced contraction in both the colon and duodenum in the same way.
After 2-bromolysergic acid diethylamide, duodenal contraction caused by ACh or serotonin decreased by over 70%; however, the contraction of the colon was not significantly inhibited.
In calcium-free bathing fluid without addition of Na2EDTA, ACh and prostaglandin E1 elicited contraction in the colon, but not in the duodenum.
Enzymic properties of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in dog serum were studied and the following results were obtained.
Some of enzymic properties of MAO in dog serum differed from that of mitochondrial MAO.
When dog serum was fractionated by ammonium sulfate, proteins were concentrated in two fractions, such as 25 approximately 33% and 67 approximately 80% of saturated ammonium sulfate fraction, while MAO activity was concentrated in 40 approximately 50% of saturated ammonium sulfate fraction.
The reaction rate of MAO in dog serum was found to be proportional to enzyme concentration.
The optimum pH of MAO in dog serum was 7.0 which differed from that of MAO in rabbit serum (pH 8.0).
Tris-HCl buffer strongly inhibited MAO activity in dog serum.
When benzylamine was used as substrate, the highest activity was obtained compared with the other substrate used.
The activities with butylamine, amylamine, beta-phenylethylamine and tyramine showed about 30% while tryptamine and serotonin showed 3 approximately 10% compared to that with benzymlamine as substrate.
The value of pI50 of catron was about 3 X 10(-6) M and that of harmaline was about 3 X 10(-5) M, but pargyline did not inhibit MAO activity in dog serum at the concentration of 1 X 10(-4) M.
A combination of two or more drugs may exert a drug-drug interaction, in which case the effect can be potentiated or antagonized.
Such synergistic effects are well known in the case of pyrabital (barbital + aminopyrine) or irgapyrine (phenylbutazone + aminopyrine).
Bucolome (BCP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, has the chemical structure of a barbiturate and also resembles the formula of pheylbutazone.
Thus the influence of BCP combination on the pharmacological activities of various pyrazolone derivatives was examined.
BCP potentiated the analgesic and antipyretic effects of 4-aminoantipyrine (4A), methylaminoantipyrine (MA), aminopyrine (AM) and isopropylaminoantipyrine (IPA), which were substituted by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring.
This potentiation occurred when the dose of BCP exceeded that of the pyrazolones, and was especially marked when combination ratio of BCP exceeded that of the pyrazolones, and was especially marked when combination ratio of BCP and pyrazolone was 2:1 mola.
The analgesic effects of antipyrine (AN), isopropylantipyrine (IP) and aminopropylone (AP), which were substituted by alkyl group or aminoacylamino group at 4-position, were not potentiated by BCP in any combination ratio.
Most pyrazolones showed additive acute toxicity in their combination with BCP, but acute toxicities of 4A and AM, which were potentiated in analgesic effects, were decreased and antagonized when combined with BCP.
The plasma concentration of AM was increased and prolonged by BCP, while that of IP remained much the same.
These results suggest that the pharmacological activities are associated with certain molecular interactions between BCP and pyrazolones, which are substituted by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring.
We have already reported that bucolome (BCP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, potentiates significantly the analgesic and antipyretic effects of pyrazolones which are substituted by alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring.
The solubility of BCP was markedly increased in proportion to elevation of aminopyrine (AM) concentration, but not by a combination with isopropylantipyrine (IP).
The binding of BCP to bovine serum albumin was slightly inhibited by AM, but not by IP.
From the calculation of the charge on an atom, the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the frontier electron density, BCP is considered to be a good electron acceptor.
The beta-units of Mho of pyrazolones were found to correlate with the potentiation coefficient of analgesic activity in combination drugs.
These results suggest that the complex formation between BCP and pyrazolones is an important factor for the synergism of action and is due to the charge transfer interaction and the hydrogen binding of both molecules.
FDP aldolase was found to be present in the cell-free extracts of Rhizobium leguminosarum, Rhizobium phaseoli, Rhizobium trifolii, Rhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium lupini, Rhizobium japonicum and Rhizobium species from Arachis hypogaea and Sesbania cannabina.
The enzyme in 3 representative species has optimal activity at pH 8.4 in 0.2M veronal buffer.
The enzyme activity was completely lost by treatment at 60 degrees C for 15 min.
The Km values were in the range from 2.38 to 4.55 X 10(-6)M FDP.
In the presence of amino sugars D-glucosamine and D-galactosamine no spontaneous competence could be observed in the highly transformable R6bd strain of Pneumococcus or it was decreased by several orders of magnitude.
The highest inhibition of competence was detected when the amino sugar at a concentration 5 mg/ml of the medium was added not only to the transformation but also to the pretransformation medium.
After a 150 min growth in the transformation medium in the presence of the amino sugar a 3--4-fold greater number of cells (as a viable count) could be detected as compared with the control without the amino sugar.
It was found microscopically that the amino sugar prevents natural agglutination, which normally occurs in the competent culture.
The role of specific amino sugar determinants for binding of the competence factor on the cell surface and the resulting inhibitory effect of these sugars on the development of competence are discussed.
The inhibitory effect of molybdenum ions on growth of yeasts at pH 5.5 was found to be decreased by aldoses in the following order: D-talose greater than L-mannose greater than L-ribose greater than D-lyxose greater than L-galactose greater than L-arabinose greater than L-glucose greater than L-xylose.
The glucose transport system of membrane vesicles isolated from Acholeplasma laidlawii is saturable, with a Km of 21.2 mum and V of 0.68 nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1.
The process is pH-dependent and a break occurs in the Arrhenius plot at 15 degrees C. Exogenous substrates did not stimulate glucose transport probably due to their inability to penetrate into membrane vesicles.
3-O-Methylglucose and 6-deoxyglucose competitively inhibited glucose transport.
Maltose inhibited transport of glucose noncompetitively.
These sugars also elicited glucose efflux from preloaded membrane vesicles.
Tritium-labelled 4-deoxy-D-glucose (4-dglc) and 6-deoxy-D-glucose (6-dgcl) were prepared by catalytic hydrogenolysis of the corresponding deoxyiodo derivatives with gaseous tritium.
The two sugars are transported into Saccharomyces cerevisiae by both the constitutive glucose and the inducible galactose carrier.
The pH optimum in uninduced cells lies at 5.5 for both sugars, the apparent activation energies (between 15 and 35 degrees C) are 25.1 kJ/mol and 16.5 kJ/mol, respectively.
The steady-state intracellular concentration of both sugars is less than the extracellular one (no uphill transport).
Neither of them is a substrate of yeast hexokinase.
4-Deoxy-D-glucose undergoes a dinitrophenol-sensitive conversion to an unknown metabolite which is not phosphorylated and may represent one of its oxidation products.
Twenty-five Penicillium species isolated from Egyptian soil were examined for their ability to produce gluconic acid in surface culture.
Of the eight species capable of producing gluconic acid, Penicillium puberulum gave the maximum yield (91% gluconic acid from glucose after 7 days of fermentation with 3% CaCO3).
Peptone was the best nitrogen source for acid fermentation and glucose was superior to sucrose.
An initial pH of 6.1 was most favourable for acid accumulation and addition of CaCO3 was necessary for maximum acid production.
A simple method of isolation and purification of cultures of higher fungi, mainly wood-rotting fungi, without special requirements for the presence of nitrogencontaining nutrients is described.
Parts of fruiting bodies, spores or infected wood is inoculated on Petri dishes with an agar medium of the following composition: 1.0 g KH2PO4, 0.2 g MgSO4 - 7 H2O, 0.1 g caSO4, 0.01 g Fe2(SO4)3, 10.0 g glucose, tap water to 1 litre; 20.0 g agar.
This medium does not suit most of the contaminants but fungal hyphae overgrow the whole surface of the dish so that a purified culture can be obtained from parts distant from the inoculation site.
Through this study, the bubble oxygenator with Zuhdi's heat exchange was used.
Moderate hypothermia with surface cooling and hemodilution perfusion with 5 per cent D/W was evaluated in 32 mongrel dogs and 16 clinical open heart cases.
The results obtained here were as follow: 1) Body temperature reduction by surface cooling before bypass provided more even cooling than did core cooling by low flow partial bypass alone.
2) In regard to cardiac loading on returning the whole perfusate of the circuit to patient, approximately 20 ml/kg of 5 per cent D/W was feasible as a priming solution.
3) To reduce the blood visicosity, hemodilution technique with 5 per cent D/W was superior, and hemodilution effect during postoperative periods was temporaly.
4) The excess lactate volume postulated by Huckabee was a available index to evaluate metabolic acidosis during the extracorporeal circulation.
5) With aid of surface cooling, the acid-base balance during perfusion was kept to lesser extent than that of core cooling only.
6) This study indicated that the low priming perfusion in conjunction with surface cooling hypothermia was a reliable technique for the open heart operation and may be applied in more prolonged perfusion.
Twenty mongrel dogs, weighing between 7.5 and 13.0 kg were used to investigate the percentage limits permissible for hemodilution using a double-helical reservoir heart-lung machine which has a 1,100 ml of priming volume.
In both 40 and 50 per cent groups of intentional hemodilution by 30 minute extracorporeal circulation, remarkable anemia was inevitable and recovery was extremely slow, especially in the 50 per cent dilution group.
In both 40 and 50 per cent groups of intentional hemodilutions by 30 minute extracorporeal circulation, metabolic acidosis was observed.
In 50 per cent group of intentional hemodilution, no improvement of metabolic acidosis was observed even after perfusion.
When sodium bicarbonate was administered to 40 per cent hemodilution group, minimum alterations of acid-base balance and of serum electrolytes were observed during and after extracorporeal perfusion.
When sodium bicarbonate was administered to 50 per cent hemodilution group, metabolic acidosis was more evident than in 40 per cent hemodilution group accompanied with an increase in serum sodium concentration and a decrease in serum chloride concentration.
These data qualify the use of 40 per cent intentional hemodilution using Lactate Ringer's solution or low molecular weight dextran for 30 minute extracorporeal circulation when sodium bicarbonate is administered in adequate amounts.
A procedure for the purification of phosphodiesterase from Crotalus venom on DEAE-cellulose at alkaline pH is described.
The enzyme gives a single band in polyacrylamide gels and is free of contaminating nucleolytic enzymes.
The molecular weight is about 115000.
Concentration in an Amicon ultrafiltrator gave a highly concentrated active enzyme.
Phosphodiesterase is relatively stable and can be stored at 4 degrees C in the presence of Mg2 and serum albumin for years.
For the detection of contaminating endonuclease, an assay was used in which tRNA was the substrate and possible internal breaks were detected in polyacrylamide gel after denaturation.
With bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate as substrate, 15mM Mg2 was necessary for optimal activity.
The reaction remained linear for at least 15 min at 22 degrees C. At 45 degrees C, the liberation of p-nitrophenol was highest within 25 min of incubation.
At 75 degrees C, inactivation of the enzyme occurred after 4 min.
Digestion of tRNA by electrophoretically pure phosphodiesterase is limited to a short sequence of nucleotides at the 3'-terminus.
On the average, four percent of all nucleotides can be released from tRNA.
The optimum Mg2 concentration is 10mM and the optimum pH 9.2.
The mode of action is a random attack by the enzyme on the substrate.
The terminal AMP is completely removed at 15 degrees C after short incubation; about 400 mol of AMP were removed per min by 1 mol of enzyme.
The following CMP residues are released much more slowly; at 15 degrees C incompletely, and at 37 degrees C more or less completely in 1 h. In about 50% of the tRNA molecules, the fourth nucleotide could be removed in very long incubations or with very high enzyme concentrations.
In the blowfly, the formation of 3-dehydroecdysone from the insect molting hormone ecdysone is catalyzed by an enzyme which carries hydrogen from ecdysone and ecdysterone to oxygen.
The enzyme is therefore called "ecdysone oxidase".
Two methods are described for the detection of ecdysone oxidase activity, one using a radiolabelled substrate which is separated from the product by thin-layer chromatography after the reaction, and the other using dichloroindophenol, which is discoloured by the redox reaction.
The ecdysone oxidase is purified by a factor of 2200 from prepupae of Calliphora erythrocephala using salt precipitation and ion exchange chromatography.
The ecdysone oxidase has a Km value for ecdysone of 42muM.
The pH optimum is 6.5.
The temperature optimum lies at 45 degrees C. The ecdysone oxidase has a molecular weight of 240000.
An outpatient with phobias related to enclosed places, hospitals, doctors, and cancer was treated by systematic desensitization; the facilities of a general hospital were used for part of the process.
Steps in treatment included securing a complete psychiatric and social history, teaching the patient relaxation therapy techniques, and establishing a hierarchy of anxiety-provoking stimuli specifically related to the patient's fears.
After desensitization the patient was able to enter the hospital for tests for a physical ailment and showed a general decrease in her fears.
The kinetics and cellular characteristics of immunosuppression in (CBA-p X C57/Bl)F1 mice during graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction induced with spleen cells from either parental strain have been investigated.
Effects on PFC responses to thymus-dependent (chicken red blood cells) and independent (levan) antigens have been compared.
The unresponsive state which developed in GVH mice was expressed to comparable extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated recipients.
Furthermore, GVH spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a mixed transfer system, but this effect was lost completely by day 21 whereas the original donors (or their cells) were still totally refractory after 80 days.
This active suppressor effect was found to be mediated by T cells of perental origin based on cell fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or host cells by alloimmune attack.
The delayed transfer of GVH cells to irradiated repopulated recipients challenged with antigen, indicated that suppressor T cells exert an anti-mitotic influence on antigen-stimulated B-cell proliferation.
Supplementation of macrophage-depleted, anti-theta-treated GVH spleen cells with purified normal T cells demonstrated that B cells in GVH mice are normally reactive even when active suppression by T cells is no longer demonstrable.
The likelihood that this later phase of immunosuppression is attributable to another mechanism is discussed.
Opsonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae may be mediated by the alternate complement pathway.
To study the importance of this interaction to human disease, complement consumption by pneumococci of various serotypes was measured in humwn serum chelated with ethyleneglycoltraacetic acid, a substance that blocks the classic but not the alternate complement pathwway.
Serotype I, in contrast to all other types studied, lacked ability to consume complement in this system.
The ability for serotypes III, IV, and VIII to activate the alternate pathway could be eliminated by prior serum absorption at O C with they type in question, a condition that would remove antibody but not complement.
It was concluded that types I, III, IV, and VIII lack intrinsic ability to activate and thus be opsonized by the alternate complement pathway, although types III, IV, and VIII can do so in concert with specific antibody.
The fact that these same types are especially prominent in human disease suggests that the ability to evade opsonization by the alternate complement pathway in pre-antibody phases of infection may be a virulence factor in pneumococci.
Mycobacterial growth inhibitory factor (MycoIF), found in supernatant fluids of mouse spleen cell cultures that have been stimulated in vitro with homologous  antigen, inhibited the intracellular multiplication of virulent tubercle bacilli within normal mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro.
Antigenically stimulated H37Ra-immunized mouse spleen cells required 72 h of incubation to produce supernatant fluids that would cause intracellular inhibition.
Supernatant fluids from 48-h mouse spleen cell cultures were not able to produce intracellular inhibition.
Investigation of the culture conditions showed that at lease 1.0% human serum was required in the tissue culture medium for the production of MycoIF by spleen cells from immunized mice.
MycoIF activity was noted only in supernatant fluids from spleen cell cultures incubated with antigen for 72 h. MycoIF was nondialyzable and unaffected by freezing, lyophilization, or incubation at 60 C for 30 min.
However, MycoIF was inactivated after incubation at 80 C for 30 min.
MycoIF was unaffected by low hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 7 to 12), but exposure to higher hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 6, pH 5) significantly decrease MycoIF activity, and exposure to pH 4 to 2 abolished all activity.
Infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and products from the organism have been associated with alterations in blood clotting and function of platelets.
Pneumococci and pneumococcal polysaccharide shortened the clotting times of whole blood, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) in vitro.
Clotting times of PPP and PRP from C6-deficient animals were likewise decreased.
The bacteria had no effect on the  one-stage prothrombin time or the partial thromboplastin time when the organisms were used as activating agents.
Platelets aggregated in the presence of pneumococci,  but aggregation was prevented by the addition of cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP).
Furthermore, cAMP corrected the shortened clotting time of PRP in the presence of pneumococci.
The clumping and release of polymorphonuclear coagulant that was induced by pneumococci was not prevented by cAMP.
Thus, pneumococci exert several dose-dependent thromboplastic effects: (i) release of platelet thromboplastic substances; (ii) a direct thromboplastic effect; and (iii) release of polymorphonuclear coagulant.
Envelope preparations of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain GC1 (a stable, piliated strain of intermediate colony morphology) and type T1 possess a D-alanine carboxypeptidase which releases the terminal alanine residue from the uridine 5'-diphosphate-N-acetyl muramylpentapeptide substrate (isolated from Bacillus cereus T).
The D-alanine carboxypeptidase of the GC1 envelopes has a broad pH optimum between pH 8.0 to 10.0.
When the molarity of the tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer was varied, the activity showed an optimum over the range 0.2 to 0.4 M. Activity was higher (135% of control level) when 20 to 80 mM Mg2+ was present.
The Km for the enzyme was 0.25 mM.
The D-alanine carboxypeptidase was inhibited by several beta-lactam antibiotics and the 50% inhibitory levels were 10(-8) M penicillin G, 10(-8) M ampicillin, 10(-5) M cloxacillin, and 5 x 10(-7) M methicillin.
Staphylococcus aureus produces a phospholipase C specific for sphingomyelin (beta-hemolysin).
Erythrocytes with approximately 50% sphingomyelin in their membranes, e.g., from sheep, have been shown to have up to 60% of this phospholipid hydrolyzed by this enzyme at 37 C in isotonic buffered saline without hemolysis.
Cooling of sphingomyelinase C-treated erythrocytes to 4 C causes complete lysis of the cells, a phenomenon known as hot-cold hemolysis.
The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) to sheep erythrocytes preincubated with sphingomyelinase C was found to induce rapid hemolysis at 37 C. The treated cells became susceptible to chelator-induced hemolysis and to hot-cold hemolysis simultaneously, and the degree of lysis of both mechanisms increased equally with prolonged preincubation with sphingomyelinase C. Erythrocytes of species not readily susceptible to hot-cold hemolysis were equally insusceptible to chelator-induced lysis.
Chelators of the EDTA series were the most effective, whereas chelators more specific for Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+ were without effect.
The rate of chelator-induced lysis was dependent on the preincubation period with beta-hemolysin and on the concentration of chelator added.
The optimal concentration of EDTA was found to equal the amount of exogenously added Mg2+, a cation necessary for sphingomyelinase C activity.
Hypotonicity increased the rate of chelator-induced hemolysis, whereas increasing the osmotic pressure to twice isotonic completely inhibited chelator-induced lysis.
The phenomenon of hot-cold hemolysis may be a consequence of the temperature dependence of divalent ion stabilization.
Resistance to pneumococcal infection was tested in T-lymphocyte-deficient, nude (nu/nu) mice.
Pneumococcal serum opsonizing activity, in vivo phagocytosis of the pneumococcus, and the mean lethal dose for the pneumococcus were all found to be the same in nude mice as in control (+/+) mice.
T-lymphocytes do not appear to play a significant role in the host's defense against the pneumococcus.
PR-D-92-EA was tested on isolated guinea pig ileum and rat stomach strips for activity against mediators probably released after allergen antibody union.
It antagonized the response produced by histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2ALPHA and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A).
This compound may be useful in the treatment of allergic conditions.
Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) induction by glucagon and dexamethasone in the liver of tumor-bearing chickens was studied and compared with induction in healthy animals.
The transplantable tumor was caused by inoculation of cells from a cell line induced by MC29 avian leukosis virus.
TAT was hardly detectable in tumor tissue of control and dexamethasone-treated chickens, but it was induced by glucagon to levels which were significant although very low when compared to those in host liver or the liver of non-tumor-bearing controls after glucagon treatment.
Dexamethasone failed to induce TAT in host liver at 8 A.M. while it significantly indiced TAT in the normal liver at the same time of the day.
Similar failure of TAT induction was not detectable when glucagon was used instead of dexamethasone.
Furthermore, it was found that diurnal variations in basal and dexamethasone or glucagon-induced TAT levels are considerably mitigated in host liver as compared to those observed in the liver of healthy animals.
This paper described a Behavior Modification Training Program, emphasizing self-control, for staff working with drug addicts.
The program, which is primarily geared toward the training of paraprofessionals, takes place in ten 1-1/2 hour sessions and includes an overview of behavior modification as well as instruction in techniques of relaxation, desensitization, self-image improvement, behavior analysis, behavior control, assertive training, rational thinking, and how to set up and run similar behavior modification training programs for staff and patients.
Since this training began at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute in November 1971, a total of 898 staff members, mostly paraprofessionals working with addicts, alcoholics, mentally ill patients, and inmates, including 53 from our own institution, 576 persons from other facilities in New Jersey, and 269 from facilities in other states, have been trained, while 2,021 patients have been trained in similar programs.
Most of this training has been accomplished by paraprofessionals.
Adding dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to water, retarded hydrolysis of the ester by a factor of 2 to 500, depending on the pH of the medium and concentration of DMSO.
Ethanol also slowed hydrolysis, but the effect was not so pronounced.
Related studies show that the acetamido group C-N bond of sodium 2-acetamido-acrylate is hydrolyzed only about 1/130 as fast as the ester group C-O bond.
Aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide should by a useful medium for synthesis of peptide, amino acid and protein derivatives of N-acetyl dehydroalanine methyl ester.
In order for the ophthalmologist to achieve the greatest earning power and personal satisfaction, he or she must devise traffic flow techniques that efficiently allow for maximum utilization of all examining areas and paramedical personnel in the office without dehumanizing patients.
By delegating as much responsibility as possible to staff, the ophthalmologist will have the opportunity of performing his or her specialized skills to the fullest extent, and therefore will achieve optimal personal gratification.
This emotional reward indemnifies the future of private practice, because it can exist only in the presence of a close patient-physician relationship, which is the cornerstone of the private practice of ophthalmology.
The spontaneous activity exhibited in vitro by smooth muscle strips from the urinary bladder of the rabbit under the influence of Urecholine in concentrations from 0.3 to 30 muM has been characterized in terms of three parameters: mean tension, frequency of contraction, and contractile deviation, all obtained by computer an alysis.
At concentrations less than 10 muM the contractile patterns were almost periodic, while at 10 and 30 muM, the patterns became highly erratic.
Histologic examination of a limited number of tissues showed longitudinally oriented muscle bundles with multiple anastomosing.
Non-occluded virions of a nuclear polyhedrosis virus of the alfalfa looper, Autographa californica, found in the medium of cell cultures of infected fall armyworm, Spodopter frugiperda, and in the hemolymph of infected S. frugiperda larvae were partially characterized by biological, chemical and physical methods.
Also, the rate of appearance of the virions was studied in cell culture and the host insect to determine maximum virion production.
The non-occluded virions found in the insect cell culture fluid and in the hemolymph were identical, and both were enveloped nucleocapsids.
Visualization of the fragilely enveloped nucleocapsid was accomplished only after fixation with glutaraldehyde.
Extensively degraded RNA was isolated from virions of influenza virus which had been oxidized with sodium m-periodate.
Similarly, although to a lesser extent, RNA isolated from periodate-treated ribonucleoprotein of influenza virus was also degraded.
In contrast, influenza virus RNA, if first freed from other virion components, was not degraded by periodate oxidation.
Rubella virus failed to replicate in mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus and Culex fatigans) following parenteral inoculation.
The virus demonstrated in mosquitoes tested immediately after inoculation but was not detected in insects sampled 7, 14 and 21 days postinoculation.
This experiment provides further evidence that rubella is not an arbovirus, but does not invalidate its classification as a togavirus.
Minoxidil in daily doses of 6 to 40 mg was administered to 11 patients with severe hypertension.
Two patients died of causes unrelated to the drug and one patient withdrew from the study.
Blood pressure was controlled in the remaining eight subjects, who received the drug for periods ranging from 5 to 40 months.
In three patients minoxidil could subsequently be replaced by conventional antihypertensive therapy.
Adverse effects of minoxidil included fluid retention (as assessed by edema and plasma volume studies), nonspecific ECG changes, hypertrichosis and conjunctival redness.
Concomitant administration of diuretic and beta-adrenergic blocking agents resulted in excellent tolerance of the treatment and high patient compliance.
The secretion of alpha-amylase and electrolytes by the parotid gland is now well understood and similarities exist in this respect between man and animals.
Many modern drugs influence parotid secretion and morphology, and these are discussed.
Acute renal failure is a life-threatening situation for which satisfactory treatment is currently available.
Death is usually related to concomitant infection rather than uremia.
Prompt recognition and treatment of underlying factors that predispose to renal insufficiency can frequently prevent the development of intrinsic acute renal failure.
Local control of pulmonary resistance and lung compliance was studied in the in situ left lower lobe of the canine lung.
Recirculation of blood through the lobe while the Pco2 of the ventilatory gas was varied resulted in an increase in resistance and a decrease in compliance only when the pulmonary venous pH was greater than 7.42.
Alternating sodium bicarbonate and lactic acid infusion while alveolar Pco2 was maintained below 5 mmHg demonstrated the dependence of the hypocapnic response on the acid-base status of the blood perfusing the respiratory airways.
The increase in resistance and decrease in compliance observed at a pulmonary venous pH of 7.64 was comparable to that observed after lobar pulmonary artery occlusion.
Varying degrees of hypoxia did not significantly affect bronchomotor tone, nor was the bronchoconstriction following lobar pulmonary artery occlusion affected by the hypoxia.
Vagal stimulation superimposed on a stepwise increase in pulmonary venous pH from 7.32 to 7.62 resulted in an increase in resistance which paralleled the increase in resistance when pulmonary venous pH alone was increased.
Compliance was not significantly affected by vagal stimulation at any level of pulmonary venous pH.
A new esterification procedure was developed to form 2-chloroethyl esters for 10 common herbicidal acids, using dicyclohexyl carbodiimide and 2-chloroethanol.
This reagent was found to be more desirable than the commonly used boron trichloride/2-chloroethanol reagent.
Maximum esterification was given for picloram at a lower reaction temperature with a shorter reaction time.
Also, maximum esterification of dicamba and 2,3,6-TBA was achieved.
The boron trichloride/2-chlorethanol gave poor or little esterification with these 2 acids under the various conditions investigated.
The effect of solvents on esterification with the 2 reagents was also explored.
A previously unrecognized enzyme, citrate lyase deacetylase, has been purified about 140-fold from cell extracts of Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa.
It catalyzed the conversion of enzymatically active acetyl-S-citrate lyase into the inactive HS-form and acetate.
The enzyme exhibited an optimal rate of inactivation at pH 8.1.
Because of the instability of acetyl-S-citrate lyase at acidic and alkaline pH values, all assays were carried out at pH 7.2, where the spontaneous hydrolysis of the acetyl-S-citrate lyase was negligible and deacetylase showed 70% of the activity at pH 8.1.
The apparent Km value for citrate lyase was 10(-7) M at pH 7.2 and 30 C. The activity of the deacetylase was restricted to the citrate lyase from R. gelatinosa.
The corresponding lyases from Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly Klebsiella aerogenes) and Streptococcus diacetilactis were not deacetylated; likewise, thioesters such as acetyl-S coenzyme A, acetoacetyl-S coenzyme A, and N-acetyl-S-acetyl-cysteamine were also not hydrolyzed.
Citrate lyase deacetylase was present in very small amounts in cells of R. gelatinosa grown with acetate or succinate; it was induced by citrate along with the citrate lyase.
Fifty percent inhibition was obtained at a concentration of 1.4 X 10(-4) L-(+)-glutamate.
D-(-)-Glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, L-alpha-hydroxyglutarate, L-(-)-proline, and other metabolites were less effective.
The purification and properties of a novel type of murein transglycosylase from Escherichia coli are described.
The purified enzyme appears as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 65,000 as estimated by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis.
It degrades pure murein sacculi from E. coli almost completely into low-molecular-weight products.
The two prominent muropeptide fragments in the digest are the disaccharide-tripeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid and the corresponding disaccharide-tetrapeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanine.
The unique feature of these compounds is that the disaccharide has no reducing end group and that the muramic acid residue possesses an internal 1 leads to 6 anhydro linkage.
The new lytic enzyme is designated as a murein: murein transglycosylase.
Its possible role in the rearrangement of murein during cell growth and division is discussed.
2-Keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase of Aspergillus niger, an enzyme that has not been reported previously, was purified 468-fold.
Maximal activity was obtained at pH 8.0 and 50 C. The enzyme exhibited relative stereochemical specificity with respect to glyceraldehyde.
The Km values for 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, glyceraldehyde, and pyruvate were 10, 13.3, and 3.0 mM, respectively.
Stability of the enzyme under different conditions was investigated.
The equilibrium constant was about 0.33 X 10(-3) M.
A motile Streptococcus was isolated and its chemotactic behavior toward sugars and amino acids was studied.
Motility was optimal in the presence of an exogenous energy source and a nonionic detergent, e.g., Tween 80 or Brij-36.
Both glucose and pyruvate could serve as energy source.
Chemotaxis toward leucine was optimal at pH 7 to 8.5 and a temperature between 30 and 37 C. The Streptococcus showed a chemotactic response toward a variety of sugars.
All commonly occurring L-amino acids, except alanine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, arginine, and lysine, were attractants.
A phospholipase hydrolyzing cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl glycerol was characterized in gram-negative bacteria but was absent in preparations of gram-positive bacteria, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rat liver mitochondria.
In cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonase aeruginosa, this cardiolipin-hydrolyzing enzyme had similar pH and Mg2+ requirements and displayed a specificity which excluded phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidyl ethanolamine as substrates.
An alcohol dehydrogenase linked to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and requiring glutathione has been isolated and partially purified from two methanol-assimilating yeasts.
It differs from previously described methanol-oxidizing enzymes in pH optima, electron acceptor specificity, substrate specificity, inhibition pattern, and stability.
The normal hut (histidine utilization) operons, as well as those with mutations affecting the regulation of their expression, of Salmonella typhimurium were introduced on an F' episome into cells of S. typhimurium and Klebsiella aerogenes whose chromosomal hut genes had been deleted and into cells of Escherichia coli, whose chromosome does not carry hut genes.
The episomal hut operons respond in a manner very similar to induction and catabolite repression in all three organisms.
The small differences found reflect both different abilities to take up inducers from the medium and different degrees of catabolite repression exerted by glucose.
In merodiploid strains of Klebsiella aerogenes with chromosomal hut genes of K. aerogenes and episomal hut genes of Salmonella typhimurium, the repressor of either species can regulate the hut operons of the other species.
The repression exerted by the homologous repressor on the left-hand hut operon is, in both organisms, stronger than that exerted by the heterologous repressor.
The transport of 99MoO42- into dinitrogen-fixing cells of Clostridium pasteurianum was investigated.
Transport of molybdate in this organism is energy dependent; sucrose is required in the minimal media, and the system is inhibited by the glycolysis inhibitors, NaF, iodoacetic acid, and arsenate.
The cells accumulate molybdate against a concentration gradient, and the uptake shows a marked dependence on temperature (optimum 37 C) and pH (optimum 6.0).
The rate of molybdate uptake with increasing molybdate concentrations shows saturation kinetics with an apparent Km and Vmax of 4.8 X 10(-5) M and 55 nmol/g of dry cells per min, respectively.
Inhibition studies with the anions SO42-, S2O32-, WO42-, and VO32- show that SO42- and WO42- competitively inhibit MoO42- uptake (apparent Ki [SO42-] is 3.0 X 10(-5) M; apparent Ki [WO42-] is 2.4 X 10(-5), whereas S2O32- and VO32- have no inhibitory effect.
Exchange experiments with MoO42- show that only a small percentage of the 99MoO42- taken up by the cells is exchangeable.
The first committed step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium was shown to be catalyzed by three isoenzymes of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase.
aroG, the structural gene for the phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to gal, and aroH, the structural gene for the tryptophan-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to aroE.
aroF, the structural gene for the tyrosine-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to pheA and tyrA, which specify the phenylalanine- and tyrosine-specific branch-point enzymes, respectively.
The phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme was the predominant DAHP synthase in wild-type cells, and only the tryosine-inhibitable isoenzyme was completely repressed, as well as inhibited, by low levels of its allosteric effector.
The DAHP synthase isoenzymes were separated by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose with a phosphate gradient which contained enolpyruvate phosphate to protect the otherwise unstable phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme.
No cross-inhibition of either the tyrosine- or phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme was observed at inhibitor concentrations up to 1 mM.
The tryptophan-inhibitable isoenzyme was partially purified from extracts of a strain lacking the other two isoenzymes and shown to be inhibited about 30% by 1 mM tryptophan.
A preliminary study of interference by tryptophan in the periodate-thiobarbiturate assay for DAHP suggested a combined effect of tryptophan and erythrose 4-phosphate, or an aldehydic compound resulting from degradation of erythrose 4-phosphate by periodate.
The cellular localization of enzymes in Diplococcus pneumoniae was examined by fractionation of spheroplasts.
A deoxyribonuclease implicated in the entry of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the cell during genetic transformation was located in the cell membrane.
This enzyme, the major endonuclease of the cell (endonuclease I), which is necessary for the conversion of donor DNA to single strands inside the cell and oligonucleotides outside, thus could act at the cell surface.
Another enzyme, the cell wall lysin (autolysin), was also found in the membrane fraction.
Other enzymes, including amylomaltase, two exonucleases, and adenosine triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease, and a restriction type endonuclease, were located in the cytosol within the cell.
Spheroplasts were obtained spontaneously on incubation of pneumococcal cells in concentrated sugar solutions.
Cells that were physiologically competent to take up DNA formed osmotically sensitive spheroplasts two to three times faster than cells that were not in the competent state.
Although some genetically incompetent mutants also formed spheroplasts more slowly, other such mutants formed them at the faster rate.
A four- to sixfold increase in specific activity of dihydrodipicolinic acid synthase was observed during sporulation of Bacillus cereus.
The enzyme from cells harvested before and after the increase in specific activity appeared to be very similar as judged by pH optima, heat denaturation kinetics, apparent Michaelis constants, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose and Sephadex G-200, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Studies with various combinations of amino acids and one of the enzyme substrates, pyruvate, failed to give evidence for control of the enzyme by activation, inhibition, repression, induction, or stabilization.
Omission of calcium from the sporulation medium had no significant effect on the specific activity pattern of the enzyme as a function of age of culture.
D-Lactate dehydrogenase has been purified to near homogeneity from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii.
As isolated, the enzyme contains flavine adenine dinucleotide and a tightly bound metal cofactor.
Inactivation by ortho-phenanthroline occurs in two steps and is partially blocked by D-lactate.
Reactivation by divalent metal ions occurs, with divalent zinc being the most effective.
When ferricyanide is used as the electron acceptor, D-lactate has an apparent K0.5 of 3.3 M0.46; its binding is negatively cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 0.46.
Replacement of ferricyanide by the other components of the electron transport system yields hyperbolic kinetics with an apparent Km for D-lactate of 26 mM.
The apparent Km for ferricyanide is 2.2 X 10(-4) M. Phosphate and pyrophosphate compounds stimulate the D-lactate:ferricyanide activity.
These properties suggest that interaction of this enzyme with other electron transport proteins in the chain may enhance D-lactate binding and, hence, the rate of electron transport.
Coenzyme A (CoA) transferase from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii has been purified and crystallized, and some of its properties have been established.
The work was facilitated by a newly developed coupled and continuous spectrophotometric assay in which the disappearance of added acrylate could be followed at 245 nm.
The rate-limiting conversion of acetyl- and beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA to acrylyl CoA by CoA transferase was followed by the non-rate-limiting conversion to beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA by excess crotonase.
Thus, a small priming quantity of acetyl CoA served to generate acrylyl CoA, which, by hydration, generated beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA.
This product then served to generate more acrylyl CoA in cyclic fashion.
The net result was the CoA transferase-limited conversion of acrylate to beta-hydroxypropionate.
The purified transferase has a molecular weight of 125,000 and is composed of two subunits of 63,000 each, as determined by disc gel electrophoresis.
Incubation of the transferase with acetyl CoA in the absence of a fatty acid acceptor yielded a stable intermediate which, by absorption spectrophotometry, radioactivity measurements, reduction with borohydride, reactivity with hydroxylamine, and catalytic activity, was identified as an enzyme-CoA compound.
Kinetic constants for CoA transferase are: final specific activity, 110 U/mg of protein corresponding to 1.38 X 10(4) mumol of acrylate activated per mumol of transferase; Km for acrylate, 1.2 X 10(-3) M; Km for acetyl CoA (beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA), 2.4 X 10(-5) M.
Studies were made on the physical and chemical properties of polysaccharides synthesized by cell-free extracts of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus sp.
Among the polysaccharides examined, insoluble glucans were rather resistant to available dextranase preparations, and the insoluble, sticky glucan produced by S. mutans OMZ 176, which could be important in formation of dental plaques, was the most resistant.
By enrichment culture of soil specimens, using OMZ 176 glucans as the sole carbon source, an organism was isolated that produced colonies surrounded by a clear lytic zone on opaque agar plates containing the OMZ 176 glucan.
The organism was identified as a strain of Flavobacterium and named the Ek-14 bacterium.
EK-14 bacterium was grown in Trypticase soy broth, and an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the OMZ 176 glucan was concentrated from the culture supernatant and purified by negative adsorption on a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DE-32) column and gradient elution chromatography with a carboxymethyl-cellulose (CM-32) column.
The enzyme was a basic protein with an isoelectric point of pH 8.5 and molecular weight of 65,000.
Its optimum pH was 6.3 and its optimal temperature was 42 C. The purified enzyme released 11% of the total glucose residues of the OMZ 176 glucan as reducing sugars and solubilized about half of the substrate glucan.
The purified enzyme split the alpha-1,3-glucan endolytically and was inactive toward glucans containing alpha-1,6, alpha-1,4, beta-1,3, beta-1,4, and/or beta-1,6 bonds as the main linkages.
The synthesis by Streptomyces sp.
6 of an extracellular chitosanase was induced by glucosamine.
The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G-100, carboxymethyl-cellulose, and diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography.
The purified enzyme hydrolyzed chitosan (the beta-1,4-linked polymer of glucosamine) but not chitin nor carboxymethyl-cellulose.
The only products of the hydrolysis detectable by paper chromatography were di- and triglucosamine.
Sephadex G-100 chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the molecular weight of the enzyme was between 29,000 and 26,000.
Acid hydrolysates of the enzyme contained no cysteic acid or glucosamine or other carbohydrate.
At 25 C, maximum activity was obtained between pH 4.5 and 6.5.
The enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan occurred over a wide range of temperatures and was maximal at 60 C. The rate of the reaction was inhibited by concentrations of soluble chitosan higher than 0.5 g/liter.
The apparent Km calculated from a Lineweaver-Burke plot was 0.688 g/liter at pH 5.5.
Such a decrease was the result of a partial lysis of the cell wall.
After mutagenesis, surviving yeast cells are grown on plates at 25 C and later exposed to 37 C. The plates are then overlaid with a soft agar containing p-nitrophenylphosphate at pH 9.7.
Lysed cells liberate alkaline phosphatase which gives rise to a yellow color on and around colonies.
A deoxyribonuclease, which requires nucleoside triphosphate for reaction, has been purified about 150-fold from extracts of Bacillus laterosporus.
Potassium phosphate and ethylene glycol stabilize the purified enzyme.
The enzyme degrades double-stranded DNA about 100 times faster than heat-denatured DNA in the presence of nucleoside triphosphate.
Double-stranded DNA is not degraded to any measurable extent in the absence of ATP, but the enzyme exhibits activity toward denatured DNA in the absence of nucleoside triphosphate, and this activity seems to be an intrinsic property of this enzyme protein.
The optimum pH is 8.5 and the maximum activity is obtained in the copresence of Mg2+ (8.0 X 10(-3)M) and Mn2+ (7.0 X 10(-5)M).
ATP and dATP are most effective and nucleoside di- or monophosphates are ineffective.
ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate during the reaction and the ratio of the amount of ATP cleaved to that of hydrolyzed phosphodiester bonds of DNA is about 3:1.
An inhibitor of the enzyme was observed in bacterial extracts prepared by sonic disruption; the inhibitory substance is produced in the bacteria in the later stages of cell growth.
Preliminary results show that the inhibitor emerged near the void volume of a Sephadex G-200 column, and was relatively heat-stable, RNase-resistant, and DNase-sensitive.
A radioimmunoassay procedure for guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CGMP) is described.
The procedure is based on competitive binding between [3H]CGMP and non-radioactive CGMP, with separation of bound and unbound CGMP by Millipore filtration.
The binding reaction showed very high specificity to CGMP, had a broad pH optimum, and reached equilibrium within a short time.
A simple procedure for the pruification of assay samples using Dowex AG 50W-X2 resin is also described.
CGMP contents in urine samples were assayed without purification.
Injection of glucagon into healthy human volunteers resulted in a small but significant reduction in urinary CGMP level, whereas CAMP excretion increased dramatically.
Tryptophan was administered to rats under various nutritional conditions: fasted for 24 hr, fasted and refed with glucose or corn-oil, fasted and administered glycerol intramuscularly, and nonfasted.
The changes in the contents of glycolytic intermediates in the livers indicated that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [EC 4.1.1.32] reaction is inhibited by tryptophan administration in all groups of rats.
The content of quinolinate which exhibited the half-maximal effect on the contents of both metabolites was 0.1-0.2 mumole per g liver.
The rate of incorporation of 3H from 3H2O into the total hepatic fatty acids was increased about 2-fold by the administration of this amino acid to the fasted rats.
The enhancement of the rate was closely related to the increase in the citrate content.
The hyperlipogenesis was also related to the decrease of acetyl-CoA and the increase of malonyl-CoA.
The content of long-chain acyl-CoA was not affected.
These effects of tryptophan administration on the hepatic fatty acid metabolism were found in all groups of rats.
The liver content of glycerol 3-phosphate was decreased by tryptophan administration was markedly increased by glycerol injection.
The injection of glycerol into the control and the tryptophan-treated rats produced a marked increase of glycerol 3-phosphate but did not affect the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the livers of either group.
It may be concluded that, in the livers of rats under various nutritional conditions, the short-term control of fatty acid synthesis by tryptophan administration is most likely due to the activation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase [EC 6.4.1.2] by citrate.
In order to clarify how the electrophoretic behavior reflects the conformational transition of globular proteins, moving boundary electrophoresis was applied to analysis of the acid conformational change of alpha-lactalbumin.
The appearance of only a single electrophoretic boundary in the transition region of the protein suggests a very rapid transition with a half-time estimated to be smaller than 7 min on the basis of the theory of isomerizing systems in electrophoresis.
The transition is clearly reflected in the dependence of the mobility on the protein net charge, which shows a sigmoidal curve closely similar to that obtained by a Linderstrøm-Lang pH-tritration plot for the carboxyl groups of alpha-lactalbumin.
It was also concluded from the transition curves that the acidfication does not result in complete unfolding, but that a compact structure is maintained in the acidic region with an apparently expanded form as compared to the native state of the protein.
All results obtained by electrophoresis were also supported by the results of pH-jump studies, analytical gel chromatography, and CD measurements.
The multiple forms of cathepsin A (AI, AII, and AIII) purified from the lysosome fraction of rat liver by Sephadex G-200 and DEAE-Sephadex chromatographies were studied comparatively.
Forms AI, AII and AIII were stable between pH 3.0 and 5.5, and had pH optima for CBZ-Glu-Phe at 5.6, 5.8, and 5.9, respectively.
Their isoelectric points were at 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9, and the Michaelis constants for CBZ-Glu-Phe were calculated as 10, 6.6, and 4.2 X 10(-4)M, respectively.
Activity was inhibited by Ag+, Au3+, Hg2+, iodine, and p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB).
Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), toluenesuffonyl fluoride (TSF), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were inhibitory at a concentration of 10(-3)M. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, leupeptins, and antipain were not inhibitory, while chymostatin caused slight inhibition.
No distinct difference was observed in the effects of these compounds on the multiple forms of cathepsin A despite differences in the molecular weights of these forms (100,000, 200,000, and 420,000, respectively).
In immuno-diffusion analysis, cathepsin AI, AII, and AIII which had been treated with EDTA, dithiothreitol, PCMB, and a high concentration of NaCl, gave the same precipitin patterns as the untreated enzymes, but treatment with 6 M urea caused a slight alteration of the pattern.
After SDS-treatment (50 mM or more), the precipitin lines of these multiple forms fused and gave a single, identical line.
This suggests that the different forms of the cathepsin A are all composed of subunits which are immunologically identical or closely related, and that the subunits are mainly bound by hydrophobic forces.
This conclusion is supported by results obtained by poliacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS.
Recombination of ciliary dyneins of Tetrahymena pyriformis with the outer fibers was investigated using turbidimetry, co-sedimentation analysis and electron microscopy.
As reported by Gibbons, 30S dynein could recombine with the outer fibers, while 14S dynein did to so a lesser extent.
At acidic pH, however, most of the 14S dynein was also rebound to the outer fibers.
When an excess of crude dynein fraction was added to the outer fiber fraction at pH 8.2, electron microscopic observations showed that the outer doublet microtubules were decorated not only with arms but also with other electron-dense materials.
On the other hand, when crude dynein fraction was mixed with the outer fibers in an appropriate quantity, only arms were reconstituted at the regular positions of A-subfibers.
ATP had an inhibitory effect on the recombination of dynein with the outer fibers.
The acetylenic substrate, D-2-amino-4-pentynoic acid (D-propargylglycine), was oxidatively deaminated by hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase[EC 1.4.3.3], with accompanying inactivation of the enzyme.
The flavin which was extracted by hot methanol from the inactivated enzyme was identical with authentic FAD by thin-layer chromatography and circular dichroism.
The excitation spectrum of emission at 520 nm of the released flavin was very similar to the absorption spectrum of oxidized FAD.
The released flavin was reduced by potassium borohydride.
The apoenzyme prepared after propargylglycine treatment did not show restored D-amino acid oxidase activity on adding exogenous FAD.
The absorption spectrum of this inactivated apoenzyme showed absorption peaks at 279 and 317 nm, and a shoulder at about 290 nm.
These results strongly indicate that the inactivation reaction is a dynamic affinity labeling with D-propargylglycine which produces irreversible inactivation of the enzyme by a covalent modification of an amino acid residue at the active site.
To clarify the properties and functions of a trypsin inhibitor from Japanese barley in comparison with the inhibitor from Pirkka barley, an inhibitor was isolated from  the barley Hordeum distichum L var.
emend Lamark by extraction with 1% NaCl, ammonium sulfate fractionation and repeated chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose.
The final purified preparation of the inhibitor was found to be homogeneous by both chromatographic and electrophoretic analysis.
The inhibitor was thermostable and was stable over the broad pH range from 2 to 11.
No inhibition was observed by heavy metal ions and many reagents at 10(-2) M, except that p-chloromercuribenzoate caused a 69% loss of activity.
The inhibitor was subjected to isoelectric focusing at pH 7.51 and its molecular weight was calculated to be 14,200+/-900 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate.
The apparent dissociation constant for the complex between the inhibitor and trypsin[EC 3.4.21.4] was 1.64 X 10(-7)M with casein as a substrate.
One microgram of purified inhibitor inhibited 1.5 mug of pure trypsin in the hydrolysis of alpha-N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide.
By chemical modification of arginyl residues in the inhibitor with 1,2-cyclohexanedione, the inhibitor was shown to be an arginine inhibitor.
The inhibitor contained relatively many basic amino acids and few half cystines as compared with Pirkka barley trypsin inhibitor.
Adenine and pyridine nucleotide levels as well as those of phosphate, phosphocreatine, lactate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, glucose, and glycogen were measured in histologically defined parietal and mucous cell sections of biopsies of dog gastric mucosa at rest, and in various secretory states.
As a result of stimulation of secretion, there appeared to be no change in adenine nucleotide levels, or phosphocreatine, but there was a rise in inorganic phosphate and a fall in phosphorylation potential.
However, there was a marked increase in NADH, but no change in NADPH with onset of acid secretion.
The increase in the lactate to pyruvate ratio showed that the increased NADH level occurred in the cytoplasm and these data are discussed with reference to change in cell pH.
The binding of triiodothyronine by Rana catesbeiana tadpole tail fin, tail muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol was studied using dextran-coated charcoal to separate bound and free hormone.
A metal ion dependency was suggested by the fact that EDTA decreased the binding of triiodothyronine 80 to 90% in tail fin and tail muscle cytosol.
Inhibition of binding in kidney or liver was less, 40 to 50%.
This inhibition could be restored by adding an excess of divalent cations with an order of potency of Mn2+ greater than Ca2+ congruent to Co2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Mg2+.
o-phenanthroline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetate also decreased the binding of triiodothyronine, whereas citrate, oxalate, imidazole, and glycine had no effect.
The triiodothyronine binding capacity of tail fin cytosol was reduced by EDTA treatment and dialysis against buffer.
Ca2+ in the 1 to 10 mM range and Mn2+ at 1 mM could restore the binding to normal levels.
Higher Mn2+ increased binding 70% above normal or to Ca2+-restored levels.
The triiodothyronine cytosol binding activity was nondialyzable, heat-labile.
pH-dependent, pronase-digestible, but unaffected by incubation with trypsin, RNase, and DNase, suggesting that the cytosol binding sites are acidic proteins.
Scatchard analysis of triiodothyronine binding by the cytosol of different tissues, revealed Kassoc of 7.1 x 10(6) M(-1), 11.6 x 10(6) M(-1), 3.6 X 10(6) M(-1), and 68.0 x 10(6) M(-1) for tail fin, tail muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol, respectively.
The corresponding maximal binding capacities in picomoles per mg of crude cytosol protein in these four tissues were 10.4, 0.86, 1.3, and 0.04, respectively.
Cytochrome P-450 from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria exists in three forms of molecular weight: 850,000 (protein 16), of one-half (protein 8), and of one-quarter of this value (protein 4).
The forms of the enzyme are named according to the number of subunits and all appear to be active in converting cholesterol to 3beta-hydroxy-5-pregnen-20-one (side chain cleavage) (Shikita, M., and Hall, P.F.
To determine whether all three forms are active at their characteristic molecular weights, the three cytochromes were each layered onto separate sucrose density gradients and centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 60 min; the gradients contained all the factors necessary for side chain cleavage including one of the following substrates: cholesterol, 20S-hydroxycholesterol, and 20S,22R-dihydroxycholesterol.
Regardless of the form of P-450 layered onto the gradient and regardless of the substrate, enzyme activity (side chain cleavage) was observed only in fractions corresponding to a sedimentation coefficient of 20 to 22 S which is that for protein 16.
No activity was observed at S values corresponding to either protein 8 or protein 4.
These findings indicate that the active form of cytochrome P-450 from adrenocortical mitochondria is that containing 16 subunits, i.e.
the form in which the cytochrome is normally isolated from adrenal mitochondria.
Forms consisting of eight and four subunits which can be prepared from protein 16 become active only by forming protein 16, at least in an aqueous medium in vitro.
Clostridium perfringens sialidase was purified by affinity chromatography.
Kinetic properties of the enzyme were examined with sialyllactose and with mixed sialoglycolipids (gangliosides) as substrates.
With the latter substrate in 0.01 M Tris-acete in the absence of strong electrolyte, the pH optimum for enzymatic activity was 6.8.
Addition of strong electrolyte (0.01 to 0.10 M Nac1) to the reaction medium caused an acidic shift and a broadening of the pH optimum, Enzymatic activity at pH 5.8 rose approximately 2.5-fold; a concomitant loss of activity at pH 6.8 was also observed.
Thus, a reversible transition of the enzyme from a relatively inactive to a highly active form occurred as a function of strong electrolyte concentration.
Determination of the pK values of the active functional groups of C. perfringens sialidase revealed that the effects of strong electrolyte were exerted upon the pKa group of the enzyme.
Collectively, these findings indicate that ionic environment may effectively control the activity and relative substrate specificity of C. perfringens sialidase at a given pH.
Furthermore, they explain the low pH optima and skewed pH profiles previously reported for enzymatic activity toward high molecular weight substrates.
Reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase from bovine heart mitochondria (complex III) was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis procedure.
Soybean phospholipids or mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin could be used.
Oxidation of reduced coenzyme Q2 by the reconstituted vesicles with cytochrome c as oxidant showed the following energy-coupling phenomena.
Measurements with mitochondria under similar conditions showed an H+/2e ratio of 1.8.
Proton translocation was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net acidification of the medium from the over-all oxidation reaction.
Potassium ions were taken up by the reconstituted vesicles in the presence of valinomycin in a reaction coupled to electron transfer.
The coupling ratio for K+ uptake, K+/2e, was 2.0 in the vesicles and approximately 1.5 in mitochondria.
The rate of oxidation of reduced coenzyme Q2 by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated up to 10-fold by uncouplers or by valinomycin plus nigericin and K+ ions.
Addition of valinomycin alone in a K+ medium caused a transient stimulation of electron transfer.
The results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with isolated reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle.
NADH-coenzyme Q reductase from bovine heart mitochondria (complex I) was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis procedure.
Mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were required.
Oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q1 catalyzed by the reconstituted vesicles was coupled to proton translocation, directed inward, with an H+/2e ratio greater than 1.4.
Similar experiments measuring proton translocation in submitochondrial particles gave an H+/2e ratio of 1.8.
The proton translocation in both systems was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net proton uptake from the reduction of coenzyme Q1 by NADH.
The rate of electron transfer by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated about 3-fold by uncouplers or by valinomycin plus nigericin and K+ ions.
The results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with isolated NADH-coenzyme Q reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle.
Crude particulate preparations obtained from anaerobic, light-grown cells of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides have been shown to possess a significant level of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15) activity.
In contrast to the enzyme from Escherichia coli, the R. spheroides glycerophosphate acyltransferase has a high specificity for acyl thiolester derivatives of acyl carrier protein (ACP) as acyl donors for the reaction.
Only limited , nonlinear glycerophosphate incorporation into lipid occurs when acyl coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives are employed as acyl substrate.
With oleyl-ACP as substrate, maximal enzyme activity was observed at 40 degrees, over a broad pH range (6.0 to 8.5) and did not require a divalent metal cation.
When oleyl-ACP or palmityl-ACP was employed as sole acyl group donor, the major products recoverable from the reaction mixtures were lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, and monoglyceride.
Althouh oleyl-ACP and palmityl-ACP gave comparable maximal velocities in the initial acylation of glycerophosphate, the formation of phosphatidic acid occurred preferentially with the unsaturated acyl-ACP derivative.
Thyroxine-binding globulin was isolated from human plasma by ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatographic separations on diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex, gel chromatography, and two different electrophoretic procedures.
The highly purified was homogeneous when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation analyses, and immunochemical determinations.
The weight average molecular weight as determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugations was 54,000 and by sedimentation diffusion data 55,000.
Amino acid analyses indicated a minimum of 110 amino acid residues per molecule.
By determination of the minimum in the curve for the fraction of maximum deviation from the amino acid analyses it was found that the minimum molecular weight for the polypeptide was 12,200.
Carbohydrate analyses demonstrated the presence f equimolar amounts of amnnose, galactose, and glucosamine, and the carbohydrate portion constituted 7.5% of the total weight.
The amino acid analyses suggested that thyroxine-binding globulin is composed of 4 subunits.
Molecular weight determinations by gel chromatography in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride indicated the presence of three species of globulin with apparent molecular weights 52,000, 25,000, and 13,500, respectively.
Prolonged storage in guanidine hydrochloride promoted a more than 60% yield of the monomeric species.
Moreover, a half-molecule of thyroxine-binding globulin was isolated and shown to consist of two polypeptide chains of similar molecular weight...
Heterogeneities of the two ovalbumin glycopeptides, (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, were revealed by borate paper electrophoresis of oligosaccharide alcohols obtained from the glycopeptides by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and NaB3H4 reduction.
Based on the results, the whole structures of the major components of (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn were elucidated as Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3]-Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3[Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc leads to Asn and Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3]Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 3]Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to GlcNAc leads to Asn, respectively.
Since endo-beta-N-acetylglucosamini dase D hydrolyzes (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn but not (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, the presence of the unsubstituted alpha-mannosyl residue linked at the C-3 position of the terminal mannose of Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4 GlcNAcAsn core must be essential for the action of the enzyme.
The apoprotein of hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase was reconstituted with 5-deazaflavin adenine dinucleotide (5-deazaFAD) to yield a protein which contains 1.5 mol of 5-deazaFAD/mol of enzyme.
The reconstituted enzyme exhibits no activity when assayed by D-alanine oxidation.
However, the bound chromophore can be reduced by alanine, phenylalanine, proline, methionine, and valine, but not by glutamate or aspartate, indicating the deazaFAD enzyme retains the substrate specificity of the native enzyme.
Reduction of the enzyme by D-alanine exhibits a 1.6-fold deuterium isotope effect.
Reoxidation of the reduced enzyme occurred in the presence of pyruvate plus ammonia, but not with pyruvate alone or ammonia alone.
beta-Phenylpyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate, but not alpha-ketoglutarate could replace pyruvate.
Reduced enzyme isolated following reaction with [alpha-3H]alanine was found to contain 0.5 mol of tritium/mol of deazaFADH2.
After denaturation of the tritium-labeled enzyme, the radioactivity was identified as deazaFADH2.
Reaction of the reduced tritium-labeled enzyme with pyruvate plus ammonia prior to denaturation yields [alpha-3H]alanine and unlabeled deazaFAD.
NSILA-s (nonsuppressible insulin-like activity, soluble in acid ethanol) is a serum peptide that has insulin-like and growth-promoting activities.
We have demonstrated previously that liver plasma membranes possess separate receptors for NSILA-s and insulin and have characterized the insulin receptor in detail.
In the present study we have characterized the properties and specificity of the NSILA-s receptor and compared them to those of the insulin receptor in the same tissue.
Both 125I-NSILA-s and 125I-insulin bind rapidly and reversibly to their receptors in liver membranes; maximal NSILA-s binding occurs at 20 degrees while maximal insulin binding is seen at 1-4 degrees.
The pH optimum for NSILA-s binding is broad (6.0 to 8.0), in contrast to the very sharp pH optimum (7.5 to 8.0) for insulin binding.
Both receptors exhibit a high degree of specificity.
With the insulin receptor, NSILA-s and insulin analogues compete for binding in proportion to their insulin-like potency: insulin greater than proinsulin greater than NSILA-s. With the NSILA-s receptor, NSILA-s is most potent and the order is reversed: NSILA-s greater than proinsulin greater than insulin.
NSILA-s which had been inactivated biologically by reduction and aminoethylation and growth hormone were less than 1/100,000 as potent as the most purified NSILA-s preparation.
Purified preparations of fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, and somatomedins B and C were less than 1% as effective as NSILA-s in competing for the 125I-NSILA-s suggesting that these factors act through other receptors.
In contrast, somatomedin A was 10% as active as NSILA-s and multiplication-stimulating activity was fully as active as NSILA-s in competing for the NSILA-s receptor.
Analysis of the data suggests that there are approximately 50 times more insulin receptors than NSILA-s receptors per liver cell, while the apparent affinity of NSILA-s receptors is somewhat higher than that of the insulin receptor.
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which has been isolated from chicken liver mitochondria in essentially homogenous form, carries out the irreversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to pyruvate in the presence of catalytic amounts of GDP or IDP, as well as the reversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of substrate amounts of GTP or ITP.
The pyruvate- and phosphoenolpyruvate-forming reactions are similar in their nucleoside specificity and appear to be carried out by the same protein.
Phosphoenolpyruvate formation is completely dependent on the presence of a divalent metal ion, with Mn2+ the most effective species.
This reaction is also stimulated by sulfhydryl reagents such as 2-mercaptoethanol.
In contrast, the pyruvate-forming reaction is strongly inhibited by divalent metal ions, including Mn2+, and also by moderate concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents.
These observations and the demonstration that pyruvate kinase-like activity is very low or absent make it unlikely that pyruvate formation proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate as an intermediate.
Although the pyruvate-forming reaction is inhibited by added metal ions, the reaction is also inhibited by metal-chelating agents such as 8-hydroxyquinoline and o-phenanthroline, suggesting that the reaction is dependent on the presence of a metal ion.
It has not been possible, however, to demonstrate that the enzyme is a metalloprotein.
Hemoglobin Deer Lodge is an abnormal human hemoglobin with arginine substituted for histidine at the beta 2 position.
X-ray crystallography of normal human hemoglobin has shown that the beta 2 residue is normally part of the binding site for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.
The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 affects both the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding.
When stripped of anions, Hb Deer Lodge has an increased oxygen affinity and a decreased degree of cooperativity relative to Hb A.
The alkaline Bohr effect is slightly increased and there are marked increases in oxygen affinity below pH 6 and above pH 8.
In the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate the cooperativity in increases to nromal and the pH dependence of oxygen binding is reduced.
This contrasts with the enhanced Bohr effect seen for Hb A in the presence of organic phosphates.
Due to enhanced anion binding at high pH, Hb Deer Lodge has a slightly lower oxygen affinity than Hb A at pH 9 in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate.
Kinetic studies at neutral pH in the absence of organic phosphates revealed biphasicity in the rate of oxygen dissociation from Hb Deer Lodge, while approximately linear time courses were observed for Hb A.
The fast phase of the oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great pH sensitivity, and organic phosphates increase the rate and percentage of the fast phase without greatly affecting the slow phase.
The two phases are not resolvable at high pH.
CO combination kinetics are much like those of Hb A except that "fast" and "slow" phases were apparent at wavelengths near the deoxy-CO isobestic point.
After flash photolysis of the CO derivative, the percentage of quickly reacting material was slightly greater for Hb Deer Lodge than for Hb A.
This may imply a somewhat greater tendency to dissociate into high affinity subunits.
The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 thus results in a macromolecule whose ligand-binding properties are significantly altered, the primary differences being expressed at high pH where Hb Deer Lodge binds anions more strongly than Hb A.
The properties of Hb Deer Lodge are compared to those of other hemoglobin variants with substitutions at residues involved in binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.
We describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous substrates of human platelet homogenates and membranes.
The method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are odd-chained and therefore suitable as internal reference compounds that, at the time of lipid extraction, can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to specific lipids.
In homogenates at pH 4.0 a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides.
However, enough arachidonic acid was released at this pH level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid.
With membranous preparations, in the alkaline pH range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids.
At pH 8.5, where release of the saturated acids, palmitic and stearic, predominated, their sum was 3.5 times that of arachidonic acid.
At pH 9.5 the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak values; however, the release of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids.
Linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released arachidonic acid, despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the 2-position of phospholipids.
Pertinently, the choline phospholipids are linoleic-rich and the non-choline phospholipids linoleic-poor, while both have a generous endowment of arachidonic acid.
With this in mind, we raise the possibility that the phospholipase A2 of human platelets is an endoenzyme because of its tendency to act on those phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the cell membrane.
Treatment of submitochondrial particles (ETP) with trypsin at 0 degrees destroyed NADPH leads to NAD (or 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, AcPyAD) transhydrogenase activity.
NADH oxidase activity was unaffected; NADPH oxidase and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenase activities were diminished by less than 10%.
When ETP was incubated with trypsin at 30 degrees, NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase activity was rapidly lost, NADPH oxidase activity was slowly destroyed, but NADH oxidase activity remained intact.
The reduction pattern by NADPH, NADPH + NAD, and NADH of chromophores absorbing at 475 minus 510 nm (flavin and iron-sulfur centers) in complex I (NADH-ubiquinone reductase) or ETP treated with trypsin at 0 degrees also indicated specific destruction of transhydrogenase activity.
The sensitivity of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase reaction to trypsin suggested the involvement of susceptible arginyl residues in the enzyme.
Treatment of ETP with the specific arginine-binding reagent, butanedione, inhibited transhydrogenation from NADPH leads to NAD (or AcPyAD).
It had no effect on NADH oxidation, and inhibited NADPH oxidation and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenation by only 10 to 15% even after 30 to 60 min incubation of ETP with butanedione.
The inhibition of NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation was diminished considerably when butanedione was added to ETP in the presence of NAD or NADP.
When both NAD and NADP were present, the butanedione effect was completely abolished, thus suggesting the possible presence of arginyl residues at the nucleotide binding site of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase enzyme.
Under conditions that transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD was completely inhibited by trypsin or butanedione, NADPH oxidation rate was larger than or equal to 220 nmol min-1 mg-1 ETP protein at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees.
The above results establish that in the respiratory chain of beef-heart mitochondria NADH oxidation, NADPH oxidation, and NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation are independent reactions.
A method is described for the extensive purification of acid deoxyribonuclease (acid DNase) and its specific inhibitor from beef liver, the existence of which had been only supported by indirect evidence.
One of them (molecular weight, 59,000) was identified as responsible for phosphodiesterase activity which is often a contaminant of DNase preparations.
Acid DNase (free of phosphodiesterase) and its inhibitor have been obtained as homogeneous proteins, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
The molecular weight of acid DNase and its inhibitor are, respectively, 26,500 and 21,500; those of other proteins range from 17,000 to 112,000.
The properties of beef liver acid DNase are similar to those described for the enzymes extracted from other sources.
The same alteration of DNase kinetics by this inhibitor, as that previously demonstrated with an impure protein has been confirmed; the sigmoidal shape observed at pH 5 for the plot of initial rate versus substrate concentration progressively disappears with increasing pH.
We have also demonstrated that RNA, which inhibits the acid DNase through a competitive binding to the catalytic site, is able, like the substrate, to reverse the binding of inhibitor to the enzyme.
Nucleotides have at least two functions in eukaryotic cilia and flagella.
ATP, originating in the cells, is utilized for motility by energy-transducing protein(s) called dynein, and the binding of guanine nucleotides to tubulin, and probably certain transformations of the bound nucleotides, are prerequisites for the assembly of microtubules.
Besides dynein, which can be solubulized from Chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous, Mg2+ or Ca2+-activated ATPase, we have purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide transformations.
A homogeneous, low molecular weight, Ca2+-specific adenosine triphosphatase was isolated, which was inhibited by Mg2+ and was not specific for ATP.
This enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with proteases.
It was absent from extracts of Tetrahymena cilia.
Its function might be an auxiliary energy transducer, or in steering or tactic responses.
Two species of adenylate kinase were isolated, one of which was much elevated in regenerating flagella; the latter was also present in cell bodies.
Two soluble enzyme species were identified, one of which was also present in cell bodies.
Since these enzymes are of interest because they might function in microtubule assembly, we studied the extent to which brain nucleoside diphosphokinase co-polymerizes with tubulin purified by repeated cycles of polymerization.
Arginine kinase was not detected in Chlamydomonas flagellar extracts.
A sialytransferase activity which catalyzes the synthesis of sialosylgalactosylceramide (G7) from added galactocerebroside and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid has been demonstrated in mouse brain microsomes.
The enzyme reaction shows a pH optimum of 6.3 and requires detergents.
Both Mn2+ and Ca2+ inhibited the reaction, whereas Mg2+ had no effect.
The apparent Km for galactocerebroside leading to G7 was estimated to be 8.7 X 10(-4) M. The same microsomal preparation also synthesized hematoside when ceramide lactoside was the glycolipid acceptor.
The apparent Km for ceramide lactoside was about one-tenth that for galactocerebroside.
When the preparations were partially inactivated by heat the synthesis of G7 and of hematoside was reduced at approximately the same rate.
Liver appeared to have the highest activity for G7 synthesis (as well as of hematoside), followed by brain.
The synthesis of B7 by mouse brain microsomes in vitro demonstrates a new pathway for brain ganglioside synthesis.
We described earlier the facilitated purifications of the trypsin and aminopeptidase components present in Pronase (Vosbeck, K. D., Chow, K. -F., and Awad, W. M., Jr. (1973) J. Biol.
A partially resolved protein mixture left over after one of the steps in that procedure was passed through a Sephadex G-75 column.
By this means, a component with carboxypeptidase activity was separated from associated serine endopeptidases.
Further purification of this exopeptidase to apparent homogeneity was acheived by refiltration through the same Sephadex column and by CM-cellulose chromatography.
A single protein band was observed after acrylamide gel electrophoresis; analysis by sedimentation equilibrium using the meniscus depletion method gave a molecular weight of 30,300.
This enzyme demonstrates activity against Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylglycyl-L-leucine and hippuryl-D,L-phenyllactate; no activity was found against Nalpha-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester, Nalpha-benzoyl-D,L-arginine-p-nitroanilide, or L-leuckne-p-nitroanilide.
The maximum activity lies between pH values of 7 and 8; the enzyme is stable between pH values of 6 and 10.
At room temperature 1,10-phenanthroline inactivates the enzyme completely whereas EDTA has no effect.
The metal in the native protein was found to be zinc.
These findings are similar to those recorded with bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase A, and suggest the possibility that the present enzyme may ge genetically related to the mammalian protein, as in previously noted examples of homology of three Pronase endopeptidases to pancreatic serine enzymes.
Location of electron transport chain components in chloroplast membranes of chlamydomonas reinhardi, y-1 was investigated by use of proteolytic digestion with soluble or insolubilized trypsin.
Digestion of intact membrane vesicles with soluble trypsin inactivates the water-splitting system, the 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibition site of Photosystem II, the electron transport between the two photosystems as well as the ferredoxin NADP reductase.
Electron transfer activities of Photosystems I and II reaction centers were resistant to trypsin digestion either from outside or from within the thylakoids when active trypsin was trapped inside the membrane vesicles by sonication and digestion carried out in the presence of trypsin inhibitor added from outside.
In the latter case, the water-splitting system was also found to be resistant to digestion.
Photosynthetically active membranes obtained at different stages of development showed a basically similar behavior toward trypsin.
The interactions of cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c from bovine cardiac mitochondria were investigated.
Cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c formed a 1:1 molecular complex in aqueous solutions of low ionic strength.
The complex was stable to Sephadex G-75 chromatography.
The formation and stability of the complex were independent of the oxidation state of the cytochrome components as far as those reactions studied were concerned.
The complex was dissociated in solutions of ionic strength higher than 0.07 or pH exceeding 10 and only partially dissociated in 8 M urea.
No complexation occurred when cytochrome c was acetylated on 64% of its lysine residues or photooxidized on its 2 methionine residues.
more cytochrome c) were obtained when polymerized cytochrome c, or cytochrome c with all lysine residues guanidinated, or a "1-65 heme peptide" from cyanogen bromide cleavage of cytochrome c was used.
These results were interpreted to imply that the complex was predominantly maintained by ionic interactions probably involving some of the lysine residues of cytochrome c but with major stabilization dependent on the native conformations of both cytochromes.
The reduced complex was autooxidizable with biphasic kinetics with first order rate constants of 6 X 10(-5) and 5 X U0(-5) s-1 but did not react with carbon monoxide.
The complex reacted with cyanide and was reduced by ascorbate at about 32% and 40% respectively, of the rates of reaction with cytochrome c alone.
The complex was less photoreducible than cytochrome c1 alone.
The complex exhibited remarkably different circular dichroic behavior from that of the summation of cytochrome c1 plus cytochrome c. We concluded that when cytochromes c1 and c interacted they underwent dramatic conformational changes resulting in weakening of their heme crevices.
All results available would indicate that in the complex cytochrome c1 was bound at the entrance to the heme crevice of cytochrome c on the methionine-80 side of the heme crevice.
Incubation of leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens) (EC 3.4.1.1) with various concentrations of Mg2+ at various pH values in 1 M KCl and 0.155 M trimethylamine-HCl at 37 degrees confirms that Mg2+ competes with Zn2+ for binding only 1 site per 54,000-dalton subunit.
The ratio of the apparent association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) at this site (site 1) was estimated to be 20,720 at pH 8.16, 10,570 at pH 8.44, 3,590 at pH 8.78, and 660 AT PH 9.14.
The decrease in values of 1KZn/Mg with increasing pH in the activation of leucine aminopeptidase by Mg2+ is attributed to the lowering of the free Zn2+ concentration relative to that of free Mg2+ caused by the formation of ZnOH+ and Zn(OH)2 complexes with increasing OH- concentration.
When corrections are made for the binding of Zn2+ by OH- ions, the pH-independent ratio of association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) for the relative binding of Zn2+ and Mg2+ at site 1 of leucine aminopeptidase in 29,800.
From the effect of pH on the relative binding constant, a value (beta2) for the product of the two stepwise association constants for the formation of Zn(OH)2 from Zn2+ and OH- (Zn2+ + OH- in equilibrium ZnOH+; ZnOH+ + OH- in equilibrium Zn(OH)2) was estimated to be 4.42 X 10(10) M-2 at 37 degrees.
Values of Km at pH 7.5 AND 30 degrees with L-leucine p-nitroanilide as substrate in the presence of 0.01 M NaHCO3 are 4.13 and 2.01 mM for the zinc-zinc and magnesium-zinc enzymes, respectively.
Values for Vmax are 0.2 and 2.49 mumol/min/mg, respectively.
Large numbers of taste buds are distributed over the body surface of the channel catfish ictalurus punctatus, with the barbels having an especially high density.
L-Alanine, as well as certain other amino acids, are taste stimuli in this animal.
Epithelial tissue obtained by gentle scraping of the barbel surface was fractionated by differential centrifugation.
A sedimentable fraction (P2) was prepared that was enriched in L[OH]alanine binding activity, the plasma membrane marker enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, and the mitochondrial marker succinate cytochrome c reductase, but not the microsomal marker NADH cytochrome c redu.ctase.
Binding of L-[OH]alanine was measured using a Millipore filter method in which correction for non-specific binding was also determined.
Time, temperature, and pH for measuring binding activity were established.
At the optimal pH of 7.8, the KD for L-alanine is 4.8 X 10(-6) M. The first order dissociation rate constant at 6 degrees is 3.8 X 10(-4) s-1 and at 24 degrees it is 12.1 X 10(-4) s-1.
The second order rate constant for association is between 10(2) and 10(3) M-1 S-1.
Reversibility of the binding interaction was also demonstrates by the rapid displacement of bound L-[3H]alanine by a large excess of unlabeled L-alanine.
That the binding does not represent incorporation into protein was confirmed by the lack of effect of puromycin.
The amounts bound of several other chemostimulatory amino acids werealso determined.
Since the coronary veins and capillaries are not involved with arteriosclerotic disease the authors performed experimental, and afterwards, clinical total and selective coronary vein arterialization.
Acute myocardial ischaemia created for instance by ligation of the anterior descending branch, was treated by an internal mammary artery to regional coronary vein anastomosis.
In 21 patients the selective arterialization of the "Vena cordis magna" or of "Vena cordis media", and total arterialization of the coronary sinus was performed.
The clinical improvement and follow-up studies seem to be promising in the treatment of patients with advanced diffuse heavy coronary arteriosclerosis.
In acute myocardial ischaemia with coronarographically localized coronary occlusion, the aim of regional vein arterialization is to minimize the area of infarction.
Peroxisome proliferation has been induced with 2-methyl-2-(p-[1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl]-phenoxy)-propionic acid (Su-13437).
DNA, protein, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant.
Peroxisomal enzyme activities change to approximately 165%, 50%, 30%, and 0% of the controls for catalase, urate oxidase, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase, respectively.
For catalase the change results from a decrease in particle-bound activity and a fivefold increase in soluble activity.
The average diameter of peroxisome sections is 0.58 +/- 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 +/- 0.25 mum after treatment.
After tissue fractionation, approximately one-half of the normal peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost formation, but no change in size.
Our results suggest that matrix extraction and increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins.
The changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and soluble catalase after Su-13437 allow the calculation of their half-lives.
These are the same as those found for total catalase, in normal and treated rats, after allyl isopropyl acetamide: about 1.3 days, a result compatible with peroxisome degradation by autophagy.
A sequential increase in liver RNA concentration, [14C]leucine incorporation into DOC-soluble proteins and into immunoprecipitable catalase, and an increase in liver size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver, characterize the trophic effect of the drug used.
In males, Su-13437 is more active than CPIB, another peroxisome proliferation-inducing drug; in females, only Su-13437 is active.
The ultrastructural localization of NADH oxidase, a possible enzyme in the increased oxidative activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) during phagocytosis, was studied.
A new cytochemical technique for the localization of H2O2, a product of NADH oxidase activity, was developed.
Cerous ions, in the presence of peroxide, form an electron-dense precipitate.
Resting and phagocytically stimulated PMN were exposed to cerous ions at pH 7.5 to demonstrate sites of NADH-dependent, cyanide-insensitive H2O2 production.
Resting PMN exhibites slight activity on the plasma membrane; phagocytizing PMN had extensive deposits of reaction product localized within the phagosome and on the plasma membrane.
Peroxide involvement was demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of catalase on cerium precipitation; the surface localization of the enzyme responsible was confirmed by using nonpenetrating inhibitors of enzymatic activity.
A correlative study was performed with an NADH-dependent, tetrazolium-reduction system.
As with cerium, formazan deposition on the surface of the cell was NADH dependent, cyanide insensitive, and stimulated by phagocytosis.
Superoxide dismutase did not inhibit tetrazolium reduction, as observed cytochemically, indicating direct enzymatic dye reduction without superoxide interposition.
These findings, combined with oxygen consumption studies on resting and stimulated PMN in the presence or absence of NADH, indicate that NADH oxidase is a surface enzyme in human PMN.
It is internalized during phagocytosis and retains its peroxide-generating capacity within the phagocytic vacuole.
The beige mouse is an animal model for the human Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a disease characterized by giant lysosomes in most cell types.
In mice, treatment with androgenic hormones causes a 20-50-fold elevation in at least one kidney lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase.
Beige mice treated with androgen had significantly higher kidney beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (hexosaminidase) levels than normal mice.
Other androgen-inducible enzymes and enzyme markers for the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes were not increased in kidney of beige mice.
No significant lysosomal enzyme elevation was observed in five other organs of beige mice with or without androgen treatment, nor in kidneys of beige females not treated with androgen.
Histochemical staining for glucuronidase together with subcellular fractionation showed that the higher glucuronidase content of beige mouse kidney is caused by a striking accumulation of giant glucuronidase-containing lysosomes in tubule cells near the corticomedullary boundary.
In normal mice lysosomal enzymes are coordinately released into the lumen of the kidney tubules and appreciable amounts of lysosomal enzymes are present in the urine.
It appears that lysosomes may accumulate in beige mice because of defective exocytosis resulting either from decreased intracellular motility of lysosomes or from their improper fusion with the plasma membrane.
A similar defect could account for characteristics of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
Recently we demonstrated that ethidium bromide altered the plasma and subcellular membrane glycoproteins in control and virus transformed cells.
It is reported here that ethidium bromide also stimulated the membrane associated process of sugar transport.
The KM of the virus transformed cells and the ethidium bromide treated cells is the same as that of the control cells while the maximum velocity as compared to the control cells is significantly increased.
The transport of 2-deoxyl-D-glucose was inhibited by glucose, cytochalasin B and neuraminidase but was unaffected by variations in cell density or pH of the incubation medium.
Catecholamines produce mitotic inhibition in primary cell cultures of human keratinocytes probably via a block in the G2 part of the cell cycle.
Epinephrine produced significant mitotic inhibition (49%) at a concentration as low as 4.5 X 10(-10) M, while its analog, isoproterenol, produced 47% inhibition at 1 X 10(-10) M. Norepinephrine elicited a 49% inhibitory response at 1 X 10(-8) M. One other catecholamine, dopamine, caused a 53% decrease in mitosis at 1 X 10(-6) M. Other structurally related amines to exhibit mitotic inhibition were phenylephrine, 58% at 1 X 10(-7) M; octopamine, 47% at 1 X 10(-5) M; and tyramine, 52% at 1 X 10(-4) M. Serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-4) M. Various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the cell system.
The alpha blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on mitosis.
When added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine, no reduction of the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition was observed.
The beta blocking agent, propranolol, by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-6) M. When added along with epinephrine or noreinephrine, propranolol reduced the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition approximately 65%.
In addition, propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by phenylephrine, an alpha adrenergic agent.
However, another beta blocking agent, dichloroisoproterenol, showed strong mitotic inhibition (53%) when added to the cultures at a concentration of 1 X 10(-8) M. The effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol.
These data suggest that while beta receptors may be involved in the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition of human keratinocytes in vitro, the nature of the receptor-molecule interaction may be complex.
Initial estimates of their relative amino acid requirements have been made.
The cells grown in the defined medium retain many of the differentiated features which have been the focus of investigation in their serum-grown counterparts.
Thus, the cells in defined medium contain cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and have tyrosine aminotransferase which can be induced by glucocorticoids, serum or insulin.
These cells also produce, in small amounts, an as yet undefined rat serum protein.
Lactic acid production by chick embryo fibroblasts occurs in the absence of exogenous glucose.
Fifteen to 50-fold less lactic acid is formed in the absence of glucose than in its presence.
Nevertheless, serum and pH stimulation enhances this residual lactic acid production to the same relative extent as when glucose is present.
The amount of lactic acid formed cannot be accounted for by the catabolism of residual glucose in the medium since its concentration is less than one-tenth that of the lactic acid eventually produced.
Moreover, the residual glucose concentration remains constant or increases during the course of the experiment.
To a large extent lactic acid accumulation in the absence of external glucose is dependent on the presence of amino acids in the medium, but amino acid transport is not affected by the stimulatory agents used in this study.
The results suggest that treatments which stimulate cell multiplication also activate those enzymatic pathways which convert amino acids to pyruvic and thence to lactic acid.
Granules were isolated from the cytoplasm of the amebocytes of Limulus polyphemus, the horseshoe crab, by disruption of cells obtained from blood which had been drawn into 2 mM propranolol.
The granules subsequently were purified by centrifugation through a sucrose gradient that contained heparin.
Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of the granules revealed round or ovoid particles.
The ultraviolet spectrum of the extract of amebocyte granules demonstrated a peak at 277 nm at pH 7.4, and a shift into two peaks of 281 nm and 290 nm at alkaline pH.
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in the presence of urea at pH 4.5, demonstrated patterns similar to those observed with amebocyte lysate.
Extracts of the granules were gelled by bacterial endotoxin.
The blood of the horseshoe crab contains only one type of cell, the amebocyte.
Previous studies have shown that the blood coagulation mechanism of Limulus is contained entirely within amebocytes.
The current studies suggest that the granules, which pack the cytoplasm of these cells, contain all of the factors required for the coagulation of blood, including the clottable protein.
The intracellularly localized coagulation system is released from amebocytes when their granules rupture during cell aggregation.
Human glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase associated with NADPH was efficiently bound with agarose-bound NADP, whereas the enzyme associated with NADP was poorly bound with agarose-bound NADP.
After the elimination of haemoglobin from haemolyzate by treatment with DEAE-cellulose, the enzyme was converted into the NADPH-bound form and was applied on an affinity column.
The enzyme was specifically eluted from the column by NADP in the elution buffer.
A homogeneous enzyme preparation was obtained in high yield.
A quantitative method for the simultaneous determination of propranolol and its active metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol in human plasma is described.
Plasma samples are extracted at pH 9.6 with ethyl acetate after the addition of sodium bisulphite and the internal standard oxprenolol.
The minimum detectable concentration of propranolol is 1 ng/ml and of 4-hydroxypropranolol 5 ng/ml using 1-ml plasma samples.
No interferences from normal plasma constituents or from drugs commonly prescribed together with propranolol were detected.
The separation of amino acids has been achieved on a short column of Chromo-Beads C2 resin, with a lithium gradient-elution system.
The analysis took 8 h. The separation of asparagine and glutamine from glutamic acid was highly dependent on the sample pH and on the methanol concentration in the first buffer of the gradient.
The method has been applied to analysis of human plasma and granulocytes for amino acids.
A gas chromatographic method is described for assay of 3-(5-tetrazolyl) thioxanthone 10,10-dioxide (BW 59C) in human plasma, urine and faeces.
After extraction into 1,2-dichloroethane from alkaline medium the compound is converted to the heptafluorobutyrate derivative which is injected into a gas chromatograph and measured using a 63Ni electron capture detector.
The assay produces a linear calibration curve over the range 0-30 mug/ml when the internal standard method is used.
Reproducibility is good and sensitivity down to 1 ng injected on column is possible.
The method has been used to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of BW 59C in man and has been semi-automated by the use of an autosampler and dedicated computer.
Sheep blood agar containing 5 mug of gentamicin per ml was more often positive (89%) than either standard sheep blood agar (54%) or mouse inoculation (65%) in recovering pneumococci from 62 adult and pediatric patients.
In adults, the direct quellung test on sputum smear was a rapid, sensitive method for predicting subsequent pneumococcal isolation by culture (19 of 20 patients, 95%).
The quellung test and gentamicin plate show improved sensitivity over current techniques for pneumococcal detection and can be recommended for general use.
The dose dependence of the acute effects of ethanol upon liver intermediary metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in rats.
Ethanol was given i.p.
The liver was freeze-clamped 120 min after injection, and multiple metabolites were measured in the perchloric acid extract of the tissue.
Each group showed a significantly different pattern of metabolites, redox states, and phosphorylation potentials although the rate of ethanol disappearance, at least between the two highest dose groups, was not significantly different.
The mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH] ratios and the cytoplasmic free [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio were paradoxically most reduced with the lowest dose of ethanol and became progressively more oxidized with increasing dose.
Once established, the differences in these ratios between the groups tended to persist with time, relatively independent of the concentration of ethanol.
In a somewhat different pattern, the phosphorylation potential ([ATP]/[ADP][P1]) remained at the control level in the low-dose group but was significantly elevated in the two higher-dose groups.
The results, therefore, show distinct and complicated dose-dependent patterns of intermediary metabolism that cannot be explained completely by any one hypothesis but that imply significant dose-dependent effects of ethanol upon intermediary metabolism not directly related to NADH production.
The solubility of triclinic calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals was measured under varying conditions using 45Ca-labeled crystals, expressing solubility as micromoles per liter of 45Ca in solution.
In a 0.1-M Tris-HC1 buffer pH 7.4, the solubility of accurately sized CPPD crystals (37-20mum) was 60muM with maximal solubility being attained after about 8 h incubation at 37degreeC.
Reduction in crystal size, decrease in pH, increase in ionic strength, Mg++, citrate, and albumin all increased solubility.
The most marked effects on solubility occurred when changing the calcium concentration or by enzymatic hydrolysis of inoganic pyrophosphate to orthophosphate.
It was found that decreasing the ionized calcium level below 5 mg/100 ml resulted in a progressive enhancement of solubility.
The observed solubility-enhancing effects of albumin could be explained solely on its calcium-binding ability and thereby, altered ionized calcium level.
Diffusible calcium in synovial fluid was only 40% of the total calcium concentration, which means most joint fluids are normally near the critical concentration of 5 mg/100 ml of ionized calcium, below which solubility is enhanced.
During surgery, especially parathyroidectomy, calcium levels fall, favoring dissolution of CPPD crystals.
We speculate that the slight decrease in crystal size during dissolution frees them from their cartilaginous mold, resulting in a dose-dependent inflammatory reaction as they are "shed" into the joint space.
Crystal shedding may be reinforced by the modest fall in joint fluid pH accompanying the inflammatory response.
It is proposed that the direct analgesic effect of morphine becomes attenuated over the course of successive administrations of the narcotic by a conditioned, compensatory, hyperalgesic response elicited by the administration procedure, the net result being analgesic tolerance.
Using the "hot plate" analgesia assessment situation with rats, this conditioning view of tolerance is supported by several findings: (a) It is necessary to have reliable environmental cues predicting the systemic effects of morphine if tolerance is to be observed, (b) a hyperalgesic conditioned response may be observed in morphine-tolerant subjects when drug administration cues are followed by a placebo, and (c) merely by repeatedly presenting environmental cues previously associated with morphine (but now presented with a placebo), morphine tolerance can be extinguished.
Lorazepam (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg) was compared with pentobarbital (60 and 180 mg) for its effect on sleep in "hospital insomnia."
Lorazepam was found to be a potent nighttime sedative: 1 to 1.25 mg of lorazepam is equivalent to 100 mg sodium pentobarbital for measures of sleep quality and duration.
At this dose level it is less effective than 100 mg of pentobarbital as a sleep inducer.
Studies at higher doses (up to 4 mg) indicate that lorazepam has a wide therapeutic index.
The determination with murexide of free and protein-bound calcium in model systems of known composition, ionic strength, and pH was investigated.
The spectra of calcium murexide in the presence of varying amounts of calcium ions indicated that the absorption maximum fo calcium murexide complex occurs at 480 nm while that of murexide ion is at 520 nm.
The absorbance at 509 nm is independent of calcium ion concentration and, therefore, could be used to measure the total dye.
The spectra are pH dependent but constant in the range 6.5 to 7.0.
The apparent dissociation constant of calcium murexide is dependent upon ionic environment, ionic strength, and free calcium ion concentration.
The relationship between the apparent dissociation constant and free calcium concentration was established.
Whole casein had no effect on the absorption spectra of calcium murexide and no affinity for calcium murexide complex or murexide ion.
Beta-casein, at the concentrations employed, did not influence the dissociation fo calcium murexide.
At pH 7.0, ionic strength .1, and 2 C, Beta-casein bound calcium as if there were 8.65 binding sites per molecule, each of pK 2.23, corresponding to an intrinsic association constant of 168.9 liters per mole.
The effect of low levels of strontium, boron, lithium, molybdenum, and fluorine, alone and in combination, on hydroxyapatite solubility, bacterial growth, and acid production in five antigenic types of Streptococcus mutans was investigated.
Acid production and growth were studied in broth culture media.
The results show that low levels of strontium and fluorine can significantly reduce demineralization of synthetic hydroxyapatite by S mutans in vitro.
The authors, with 67 Gallium, have obtained positive scintigraphy of the breast only in cases of carcinoma.
Reliability of negative scintigraphy however is less good.
Isotopic investigation of the bones is important in breast cancer and reveal early osseous metastasis.
The relationship of enzymatic activity to organelle development and organelle number during differentiation of the metanephric kidney in the mouse was approached from several experimental directions.
Biochemical analyses of marker enzymes for peroxisomes (catalase and D-amino acid oxidase), mitochondria (cytochrome oxidase) and lysosomes (acid phosphatase) were performed on kidneys at ages from 17 days prenatal to adult.
Postnatal development of the metanephric kidney was found to be accompanied by a rapid increase in both the specific activity of catalase and the number of peroxisomes per 100 mu2 in the proximal tubule during the first 4 weeks of postnatal growth.
Elaboration of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was seen to parallel the increase in number of peroxisomes to which segments of ER were often in close apposition.
Extensive interactions between segments of ER and peroxisomes were readily visible in 0.5-mu sections viewed in the high voltage electron microscope.
In contrast to peroxisomes, neither mitochondria nor lysosomes followed a similar pattern of net organelle increase, suggesting that a defined population density of mitochondria and lysosomes may exist in the proximal tubule at birth, prior to complete development of the kidney.
The bone marrow reactions (that is, decrease of nucleated cell counts and increase of red blood cell counts) of mouse bone were observed 1 hr after injection of endotoxin and peaked after 18 hr.
These reactions were significantly inhibited when diphenhydramine, promethazine (antihistamines), chlorpromazine (antiserotonin), or cyproheptadine (antihistamine and antiserotonin) was given 30 min before endotoxin.
Such bone marrow reactions were also induced with histamine or serotonin and peaked 1 hr after administration.
The histamine-induced changes were inhibited by prior treatment with diphenhydramine.
These reactions were also produced by injection of a small amount of both histamine and serotonin, whereas no change was found when mice were given a single injection of a larger dose of histamine or serotonin.
These results indicate that histamine and serotonin released in mice at the initial stage after endotoxin synergistically trigger the bone marrow reactions, which then continue in the presence of further mediators.
The interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate and the effect of bile salts on these interactions have been investigated by the use of kinetic experiments and studies on the semiquantitative phase distribution of lipase and colipase activities.
The results suggest that lipase binds to hydrophobic interfaces with partial irreversible inactivation.
Bile salts in the range of micellar concentrations and above a pH of about 6.5 displace lipase from this binding, resulting in a reversible in activation.
At pH values below about 6.5, lipase binds strongly to the substrate even in the presence of bile salt, and a low activity peak is seen around pH 5.5.
This is the result of the binding of lipase to the "supersubstrate" and the activity of the catalytic site.
In the presence of bile salt, colipase promotes the binding of lipase to the "supersubstrate" but not to other hydrophobic interfaces, and catalytic activity is reestablished.
Kinetic data indicate that the binding between colipase and lipase in the presence of substrate is strong and occurs in an approximately stoichiometric relationship.
When plasma proteins are diluted with buffer the ionic strength and ionic composition of that buffer affects the interactions between thyroxine (T4) and its plasma protein-binding sites.
Increases in phosphate, chloride or barbiturate ion concentration from 50 to 200 mmol/l caused a significant decrease in the affinity of plasma proteins for T4, and a concurrent increase in the concentration of unbound T4.
These results cannot be completely accounted for by changes in ionic strength since at the same ionic strength different anions caused quantitatively different effects on unbound T4 concentration.
The degree of depression of T4 binding by the three anions studied was in the order barbiturate greater than chloride greater than phosphate.
The results of a systematic study on the composition of diluent buffer systems indicated that when a 50 mM-sodium phosphate-100 mM-NaCl buffer (pH 7-4) was used as a plasma diluent, there were unlikely to be gross changes in the T4-binding properties of plasma proteins with dilution.
Using the Falck-Hillarp histochemical technique for monoamines, evidence was found for the presence of a catecholamine in the salivary gland nerves of the moth, Manduca sexta.
The innervation was studied with the electron microscope.
Only the fluid-secreting region of the gland is innervated and the nerve endings are characteristic of monoamine-containing terminals.
Using a sensitive enzymatic-isotopic assay for catecholamines, it was found that whole salivary glands contain 0.33 mug/g dopamine but no noradrenaline.
It seems likely that dopamine mediates fluid-secretion in the salivary gland of Manduca as it does a number of other arthropods.
The response seems to consist entirely of sensory activity which may continue for periods of many minutes, provided that the stimulatory chemicals remain contacting the column.
The interval between each evoked pulse gradually increases as the sensory response progresses.
This does not result from fatigue in the conduction system but involves a genuine process of sensory adaptation.
This may occur over a period of several minutes, which is much longer than comparable adaptation in higher animals.
Physiological evidence suggests that the chemoreceptors involved are dispersed throughout the column ectoderm and are absent from the pedal disc, oral disc, tentacles and pharynx.
The basic role of the SSI in coordinating behavioural activity in sea anemones is reviewed.
It is concluded that it functions primarily as a single, diffuse-conducting unit responsible for transmitting frequency-coded sensory information from ectodermal chemoreceptors to ectodermal (and perhaps endodermal) effectors.
Histamine diphosphate was shown to selectively attract human eosinophils from mixed granulocyte populations when over 20% eosinophils were used in a modified Boyden chamber chemotactic assay system.
This effect of histamine is abolished by incubation with diamine oxidase (histaminase) and was generated by decarboxylation of L-histidine.
A linear dose dependent increase in eosinophil migration was observed between 3 X 10(-7) M and 1.25 X 10(-6) M, while higher concentrations of histamine inhibited the migration of eosinophils.
The attractant activity of histamine was not inhibited by H-1 or H-2 receptor antagonists, however, the inhibition of migration observed at higher histamine concentrations was reversed by metiamine, an H-2 receptor antagonist.
The effects of histamine upon eosinophil migration were demonstrable using three different assays: (a) counting cells that had traversed 5-mum pore, 12-mum thick polycarbonate filters, (b) counting cells that had migrated various distances into a 3-mum pore, 145-mum cellulose nitrate filters, or (c) measuring the number of cells that had traversed an upper polycarbonate filter and migrated into a lower cellulose nitrate filter using 15Cr-labeled cells.
The ability of histamine to enhance eosinophil migration was shown to be dependent upon the presence of a concentration gradient; histamine did not cause a dose-dependent increase in random motility.
Furthermore, preincubation of the eosinophils with histamine deactivate the cells to further stimulation by histamine or by C5a.
It is concluded that in low doses histamine is a chemoattractant for human eosinophils, while in higher doses histamine inhibits eosinophil migration.
These observations may relate to the influx and localization of eosinophils in immediate hypersensitivity reactions.
Comparative studies of protein structure and function can be quite interesting by themselves, and even more interesting when interpreted with respect to an animal's physiology.
In the case of fish hemoglobins, some success in the latter has been achieved but there are still many unsolved problems.
It appears that comparative physiology and biochemistry have entered an era where results from comparative studies can shed a great deal of light on biochemical mechanisms in general.
The trout hemoglobin system is an example.
Distinctive hemoglobins in this system are presently being used as high resolution probes of the ligand-binding mechanism.
Our studies suggest the possibility of using Limulus hemocyanin and other hemocyanins as structural homologs and analogs of more complex macromolecular arrays.
The rapid development of molecular structural data from X-ray crystallographers combined with the vast data of comparative physiology and biochemistry makes this one of the most exciting areas in present day science.
This paper reviews the history of understanding how biological systems can discriminate so strikingly among physically similar ions, especially alkali cations.
Appreciation of qualitative regularities ("permitted sequences") and quantitative regularities ("selectivity isotherms") in ion selectivity grew first from studies of ion exchangers and glass electrodes, then of biological systems such as enzymes and cell membranes, and most recently of lipid bilayers doped with model pores and carriers.
Major current problems involve the extraction of these molecules; how to do it, what to do when it is achieved, and how (and if) it is relevant to the central problems of membrane function.
Visual photoreceptors from both vertebrates and invertebrates are characterized by extensive elaboration of membrane which contains visual pigment (rhodopsin).
Visual pigments in all phyla examined are chemically similar: the chromophore is 11-cis retinaldehyde attached by an aldimine linkage (Schiff base) to a membrane protein, opsin.
The effect of light is to isomerize the chromophore to the all-trans configuration.
Beyond these fundamental similarities, several specific areas are discussed in which variations and differences appear.
Most invertebrate visual pigments do not bleach in the light, but instead form a thermally stable metarhodopsin, with the chromophore in the all-trans configuration still attached to the opsin.
(2) In the disk membranes of vertebrate rod and cone outer segments, the rhodopsin molecules are oriented with their chromophores nearly coplanar with the disks.
In the microvillar membranes of arthropod and cephalopod rhabdoms, on the other hand, the situation is less clear.
There is evidence for some preferential orientation of chromophores that implies restrictions on Brownian rotation.
(3) In the outer segments of vertebrate receptors, absorption of light by rhodopsin causes the plasma membrane to hyperpolarize due to a decrease in sodium conductance, possibly mediated by calcium ions.
In most invertebrate photoreceptors, light causes a depolarization due to an increase in conductance, principally to sodium ions.
A subsequent entry of calcium causes a partial repolarization of the membrane, due to a decrease in sodium conductance.
(4) For vertebrate receptors, log threshold is directly proportional to the fraction of rhodopsin bleached (Dowling-Rushton relationship).
The proportionality constant varies in different preparations from less than four to more than 30, and the physical basis for the relationship is unknown.
For invertebrates, by contrast, the dependence of sensitivity on rhodopsin concentration is much less dramatic and may well depend simply on the probability of quantum catch.
(5) In most species, vertebrate and invertebrate, the accumulation of photoproduct probably has no effect on membrane conductance, but several possible exceptions exist.
(6) Photoregeneration of rhodopsin from metarhodopsin is likely an important mechanism of recovery in certain arthropods such as diurnal insects, but dark mechanisms of recovery also exist in all phyla.
A technique utilizing Pregnant Mare's Serum Gonadotropin and Human Chorionic Gonadotropin treatment of hens (Gallus domesticus), followed by manual ovulation of the excised follicles, was developed to obtain a large number of mature ova.
Enzymes were applied to pieces of filter paper placed on the ovum.
Cock acrosin and endopeptidases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, collagenase and elastase hydrolyzed the membrane whereas exopeptidases such as leucine aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase A did not.
Phospholipase A, sulfatase, hyaluronidase, beta-glucuronidase and rabbit testicular acrosin also failed to hydrolyze the membrane.
Cock acrosin hydrolysis of the ovum surface was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor.
The surface of the ovum over the germinal disc region was hydrolyzed more quickly by cock acrosin than the surface over other regions of the ovum.
Acrosin from cock sperm caused the release of trichloroacetic acid soluble material absorbing at 280 nm from sonicated preparations of inner vitelline membranes.
Hydrolysis was greatest at pH 8.0 and was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor.
In order to test the range of pH values over which the titratable carried model for inorganic anion exchange is valid, chloride self-exchange across human red blood cells was examined between pH 4.75 and 5.7 at 0 decrees c. It was found that chloride self-exchange flux had a minimum near pH 5 and increased again with further increase in hydrogen ion activity.
The Arrhenius activation energy for chloride exchange was greatly reduced at low pH values.
The chloride flux at pH 5.1 did not show the saturation kinetics reported at higher pH values but was proportional to the value of the chloride concentration squared.
In addition, the extent of inhibition of chloride self-exchange flux by phloretin was reduced at low pH.
Our interpretation of these findings is that the carrier-mediated flux becomes a progressively smaller fraction of the total flux at lower pH values and that a different transport mode requiring two chloride ions to form the permeant species and having a low specificity and temperature dependence becomes significant below pH5.
A possible mechanism for this transport is that chloride crosses red cell membranes as dimers of HCl at these very low pH values.
The acetylcholine reversal potential (Er) of cultured rat myotubes is -3mV.
When activated, the receptor is permeable to K+ and Na+, but not to Cl- ions.
Unlike adult frog muscle the magnitude of Er was insensitive to change in external Ca++ (up to 30 mM) or to changes in external pH (between 6.4 and 8.9).
The equivalent circuit equation describing the electrical circuit composed of two parallel ionic batteries (EK and ENa) and their respective conductances (gK and gNa), which has been generally useful in describing the Er of adult rat and frog muscle, could also be applied to rat myotubes when Er was measured over a wide range of external Na+ concentrations.
The equivalent circuit equation could not be applied to myotubes bathed in media of different external K+ concentrations.
In this case, the Er was more closely described by the Goldman constant field equation.
Under certain circumstances, it is known that the receptor in adult rat and frog muscle can be induced to reversibly shift from behavior described by the equivalent circuit equation to that described by the Goldman equation.
Attempts to similarly manipulate the responses of cultured rat myotubes were unsussessful.
These trials included a reduction in temperature (15 degress C), partial alpha-bungarotoxin blodkade, and activation of responses with the cholinergic agonist, decamethonium.
Cross-reinnvervation of fast (extensor digitorum longus) and slow (soleus) twitch muscles of the rabbit showed essentially complete fast to slow and slow to fast conversion, respectively, 11-12 mo after surgery with respect to a number of physiological parameters including intrinsic shortening, velocity, and isometric twitch time to peak.
There was pronounced bu incomplete biochemical conversion as judged by Ca2+ uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum, myosin ATPase, alkali lability, and light chain complement.
The question of trophic substances of neural origin is discussed in light of the fact that chronic stimulation for 15 wk of a fast muscle produces complete biochemical and physiological conversion to the slow type.
Chitin synthase of Mortierella vinacea was present in the "microsomal' fraction (100 000 g precipitate), the 'cell-wall' fraction (2000 g precipitate) and the 'mitochondrial' fraction (10 000 g precipitate).
The properties of the 'microsomal' enzyme were investigated.
The pH optimum was between 5-8 and 6-2, and the temperature optimum was between 31 and 33 degrees C. The Km for UDP N-acetyl-D-glucosamine was 1.8 mM.
The enzyme was stimulated by Mg2+ and a slight stimulation was also effected by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
A pH-dependent, heat-stable inhibitor of chitin synthase activity was present in the soluble cytoplasm from the mycelium.
The effects of aeration and glucose concentration on enzyme production in growing cultures were also investigated; maximum specific activity of chitin synthase was associated with the cessation of exponential growth.
A new method is described for the efficient conversion of Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells into protoplasts.
The following parameters of guanine uptake determined in whole cells were unchanged in protoplasts: Km value, requirement for an energy source, sensitivity to competitive inhibitors, pH optimum, as well as the typical variation of the initial velocity of uptake observed during the growth phase.
When yeast cells were incubated for 4 to 8 h in yeast extract-peptone-glucose medium, pH 6, containing 8 mM-manganese, and then plated on selective media, there was a strong induction of antibiotic-resistant mutations.
Indirect evidence suggests that practically all resistant mutants selected were of independent origin.
The analysis of manganese-induced resistant mutants showed that most were extranuclear, while those tested showed recombination with known mitochondrial markers.
Our results suggest that manganese can be considered as a mutagen which specifically induces mitochondrial mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
An intracellular L-asparaginase with antitumour activity was purified from a strain of Citrobacter.
The optimum conditions for enzyme production by fermentation on scales up to 2700 l were investigated.
Highest enzyme yield was obtained in corn-steep liquor medium (9-2%, W/V) at 37 degrees C. Oxygen limitation was not necessary for high enzyme yield.
The specific activity of the purified preparation was 45 i.u./mg protein.
The enzyme hydrolysed D-asparagine and L-glutamine at 7 and 5%, respectively, of its activity toward L-asparagine, but L-glutaminase activity could be demonstrated only at substrate concentrations above 5 mM.
The Km values for L-asparagine and D-asparagine were 2-6 X 10(-5) and 1-4 X 10(-4) respectively.
The anti-lymphoma activity of the enzyme was demonstrated with Gardner lymphosarcoma and was found only slightly less potent that Crasnitin, the most active asparaginase so far tested in this system.
Some mutants and stock strains of Escherichia coli K12 were sensitive to acriflavine in the presence of inorganic phosphate but were resistant to acriflavine in its absence.
They mutated spontaneously to resistance to acriflavine plus phosphate.
The synergistic effect of phosphate on acriflavine sensitivity was increased at high pH values.
Genetic analysis suggested that the mutations occurred in the gene acrA.
Electron microscopic observation suggested that the presence of acriflavine plus phosphate affected the structure of the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm under it.
This structural alteration was not caused by acriflavine alone.
Acridine orange plus phosphate can more effectively eliminate the plasmid F8-gal+ than acridine orange alone.
The oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane by suspensions and ultrasonic extracts of Pseudomonas methanica was studied.
A continuous assay for the oxidation of CO to CO2 was devised, using O2 and CO2 electrodes in combination.
Stoicheiometries of CO-dependent CO2 formation, O2 consumption and NADH oxidation, and the partial stoicheiometries of methane-dependent NADH oxidation, suggest the involvement of a mono-oxygenase in these oxidations.
Evidence is presented suggesting methane and CO oxidation are catalysed by a single enzyme system, distinct, at least in part, from the NADH oxidase present in extracts.
Ethanol was able to provide the reductant necessary for CO oxidation by cell suspensions, though the metabolism of ethanol by P. methanica was found unlikely to result in substrate-level formation of NADH; the means whereby alcohol oxidation could supply reductant for the mono-oxygenase are discussed.
A modified version of systematic desensitization was used to reduce the anxiety and negative interpersonal consequences produced by a recurrent aversive dream resulting from events in the real world.
The subject, a 16-year-old incarcerated male, was first taught a standard relaxation technique.
The subject's dream was divided into 12 hierarchical imaginal scenes.
Following initial relaxation, each scene was sequentially introduced and followed by the therapist's suggestion that the subject was still very relaxed.
After three sessions with the therapists and several practice sessions by himself, the subject reported no further anxiety to the dream (which continued to occur) and improved relations with the institutional staff.
Six months of follow-up showed no recurrence of the anxiety or the subsequent irritability which the subject had initially reported as leading to negative interpersonal relations with the staff.
Arteriograms of the basilar artery reveal that dopamine given intracisternally to dogs can generate cerebral vasospasm.
This finding supports a recent hypothesis of others that dopamine may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm, especially since many substances are known which fail to produce such spasm.
Compared to blood or prostaglandin E2, however, the spasm induced by dopamine was delayed in onset, less in incidence, and usually less intense.
This study was designed to measure the response of key enzymes of ketone body metabolism in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver to diet and exercise, two conditions known to influence ketone body utilization.
A 3 (diet: control, high fat, or high carbohydrate) X 2 (kill condition: rested or exhausted) X 2 (training: trained or untrained) factorial design was used to estimate main experimental effects as well as identify significant interactions of the variables.
Physical training (treadmill running) was associated with a doubling of the activity of skeletal muscle 3-oxoacid CoA transferase, a key enzyme in extrahepatic ketone body utilization.
The activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of liver ketone body production, hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthetase (HMG CoA synthetase), was not greatly influenced by training or exhuastive exercise indicating that the metabolic control of the ketosis of exercise may more likely be a function of the supply of fatty acids to the liver rather than the activity of HMG CoA synthetase.
Feeding a high fat diet, on the other hand, significantly increased the activity of liver HMG CoA synthetase, indicating that the ketosis of fat feeding may be of a different nature than that of exercise.
The results of this study indicate that physical training is associated with biochemical adaptations in ketone body metabolism as well as fatty acid oxidation, and that trained individuals are metabolically better endowed to benefit from the ketosis of exercise than untrained individuals.
The levels of plasma carotenoids were markedly reduced in broiler cockerels infected with Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella.
The mechanisms of this depigmentation differed between the two species, being primarily associated with interference of absorption of xanthophyll (carotenoids) from the intestinal lumen with E. acervulina infection and with leakage through the damaged wall of the cecum with E. tenella infection.
Chicks reared on an essentially carotenoid-free diet and inoculated with E. acervulina showed no detectable levels of carotenoids in the blood 48 hours after being changed to a diet containing 30 mg of xanthophyll/kg.
Conversely, uninoculated chicks and chicks inoculated with E. tenella showed significant and similar increases in plasma levels of carotenoids.
Chicks reared on a diet containing xanthophyll and inoculated with E. tenella showed a more rapid decrease in plasma carotenoids than did uninoculated controls when changed to a xanthophyll-free diet.
In chicks fed high xanthophyll diets containing chromic oxide, no indication of malabsorption was seen in chicks infected with E. tenella compared with uninoculated controls, whereas chicks inoculated with E. acervulina showed significantly less xanthophyll absorption.
Conversely, a marked increase in the xanthophyll : Cr2O3 ratio was observed in the cecal contents of chicks inoculated with E. tenella compared with uninuoculated controls or those inoculated with E. acervulina.
Studies of uninoculated chicks pair-fed with chicks inoculated with E. acervulina or E. tenella indicated that the decrease in plasma carotenoids and increases in intestinal pH are not associated with the reduced intake of feed associated with infection.
The studies involving uninoculated birds with reciprocal chagnes between high and low xanthophyll diets indicated that plasma carotenoids are a more rapid and sensitive means of measuring changes in pigmentation levels than are visual skin scores carotenoid levels from the skin.
Mechanisms involved in the development of the alcoholic fatty liver in KK-Ay mice were investigated.
Incorporation studies using [14C]acetate and [3H]palmitate indicated that the half-life of hepatic triglycerides was doubled in the ethanol-ingesting mice, and utilization of the exogenous fat was significantly increases as compared with that of the control.
No persistent alteration was recognized in hepatic oxidation of palmitate, as estimated by in vitro experiments using liver slices obtained from control and ethanol-drinking mice.
Enzymic studies indicated that the activities of acetyl COA carboxylase, ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were increased with ethanol drinking.
The increment in hepatic triglycerides accumulated during ethanol ingestion was largely accounted for by palmitoleic, oleic, and linoleic acids.
These findings demonstrated an augmentation in hepatic lipogenesis as well as an increased utilization of exogenous fats.
Ethanol drinking did not cause any appreciable change in plasma triglyceride level and metabolism of adipose tissue.
In summary of the present studies, accelerated lipogenesis and increased utilization of the dietary fats may be possible causal factors in the alcoholic fatty liver of KK-Ay mice.
Response of the fetal kidney to metabolic acidosis was studied in five fetal lambs, 115-125 days gestation, in order to evaluate the renal contribution to elimination of hydrogen ion during intra-uterine development.
Experiments were conducted on healthy unanesthetized fetuses, intact in utero, with catheters implanted at hysterotomy into a fetal femoral artery and vein and into the bladder via the urachus, four or more days prior to the study.
A metabolic acidosis was induced by infusion of isotonic lactic acid, 15 m mole/kg, intravenously over a period of 90 minutes.
Serial arterial samples were taken and urine collected in fractions before, during and for three hours following the infusion, for measurements of pH, bicarbonate, lactate and electrolytes as well as urine output.
During the infusion, urine pH fell from 6.65 to 6.25 and was 6.34 three hours later (Figs.
Lactic acid infusion caused a prompt increase in urine output from a mean rate of 0.12 to a maximum of 0.28 ml/kg/min at the end of the infusion, returning to control rates three hours later.
Lactate excretion increased from 0.05 to a maximum of 4.6 mumole/kg/min at the end of infusion; titratable acid increased from 0.22 to a maximum of 4 muEq/kg/min; the rates of excretion of lactate and titratable acid were still higher than control at the end of three hours.
Ammonia excretion increased from 0.21 to a maximum of 0.56 muEq/kg/min three hours after the end of infusion.
The acid infusion caused a small but significant fall in excretion of bicarbonate.
During the 90 minutes of infusion and over the following three hours, about 800 mumole lactate was excreted while net acid excretion over the same period was no more than half that amount.
The diuresis was also accompanied by a net loss of sodium and chloride, the excretion of these ions increasing more than threefold following acid infusion; excretion of potassium decreased to one-third its rate prior to the infusion.
During the 90 minutes of infusion, blood pH fell from 7.36 to 7.13, base deficit rose from 3.8 to 16.4 mEq/L and lactate rose from 2.2 to 14.8 mM/L; there was also a small but significant rise in both blood PCO2 and PO2 (Figs.
During the following three hours of recovery, pH rose gradually to 7.29, base deficit and lactate fell to 7.4 mEq/L and 8.7 mM/L respectively.
Since renal excretion of net acid and lactate was small, the decrease in blood base deficit and lactate levels during the recovery must therefore be mainly due to equilibration in various fetal compartments as well as placental transfer.
These experiments indicate that, in the lamb fetus, intact in utero, the kidney although limited by immaturity of several mechanisms, is capable of responding to an acid load and thus can make a small contribution to fetal homeostasis.
The increase in excretion of net acid is accompanied by loss of sodium and chloride in the urine.
FHR monitoring and microanalysis of fetal blood are mutually complementary procedures, and optimal knowledge of the fetal state is achieved by making use of both, the former for the preliminary screening of all cases at risk and the latter for the purpose of deciding on obstetric management where pathological changes are evident in the FHR.
The major difficulty in obtaining a precise value for the fetal acid-base balance lies in the occurence of "falsely abnormal" cases, i.e.
cases in which the fetal pH falls during labor but the clinical condition at birth is good (APGAR greater than or equal to 7).
In our own series the incidence of such cases among fetuses at risk was 11.2% (Tab.
In the majority of these cases the fetal acidosis is thought to be a result of increased metabolic acidosis in the mother (maternogenic fetal metabolic acidosis).
The importance of the maternogenic fetal acidosis during labor lies in the fact that unless it is recognised, rapid extraction of the fetus will appear necessary on clinical grounds, although it is in fact unnecessary, since this form of acidosis has no adverse effect on the fetus.
Various parameters have been proposed for the differential diagnosis of the maternogenic fetal acidosis.
These include the feto-maternal difference in base deficit (F/M deltaBD), the materno-fetal differences in pHqu 40 (M/F deltapHqu 40) the materno-fetal difference actual pH (M/F actual deltapH), and the materno-fetal difference in base deficit of the extra-cellular fluid (M/F deltaBDHb5).
A critical analysis of these parameters has been carried out on the results of microtests performed during a 5 year period (1968-1972) at the First Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Milan University.
The cases comprised 59 regarded as normal (normal course of pregnancy, spontaneous commencement of labor at term, clear amniotic fluid, regular FHR, spontaneous birth, APGAR at 90 sec between 8 and 10, weight at birth greater than 2500 g), and 335 considered to be at risk (maternal disease, presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid and/or abnormal changes in FHR).
In all of these cases the FHR was recorded by cardiotokography, and the tracings were interpreted according to HON.
Microsamples of blood were taken from both mother and fetus during labor and the following determinations were carried out: actual pH, pHqu 40, Hb concentration, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, base deficit Hb5 (BDHb5).
The same determinations were carried out on samples of maternal blood and of arterial and venous cord blood taken immediately after delivery.
The clinical condition of the infant was evaluated by the APGAR score at 90 seconds after birth.
From the results, it was concluded that: (a) I and III are in facile equilibrium in aqueous solution but appreciable amounts of III do not exist in dilute solutions with pH values below 10: (b) the photochemical reaction of I in water (presumably a photohydration) can be reversed by lyophilization, by heatiing, and by increasing the pH of solutions to values greater than 12; (c) the photochemical reaction of I can be inhibited by protecting the aqueous solutions from visible light, and the rate in the presence of light can be reduced by increasing the concentration of I in the solution; and (d) although the chloride and sulfoacetate salts of I react identically and have similar solubilities in water, it is possible to prepare more concentrated and, hence, more stable solutions of the sulfoacetate salt by including sodium hydroxide in the solvent.
The solubility of coralyne chloride remains about the same in dilute sodium hydroxide as in water.
Hydrolysis of mazindol to form 2-(2-aminoethyl)-3-(p-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxyphthalimidine was followed spectro-photometrically in aqueous solutions at temperatures between 37 and 70degree, pH values up to 7.6, and an ionic strength of 0.2.
The effects of acetate, formate, and phosphate buffers as well as ionic strength on the observed rate constants were investigated.
An interesting nonlinear dependency of the kobs with buffer concentration was noted.
The velocity constants declined with increasing hydrogen-ion concentration; the log k-pH profile and rate law are given along with other relevant data.
The apparent solubility of hexamethylmelamine in aqueous solutions suitable for intravenous use was increased by complexation with gentisic acid.
Studies were carried out in the pH 0-8 range.
Unprotonated hexamethylmelamine did not form complexes with the gentisate ion, while the hexamethylmelammonium ion appeared to form several different complexes with both the gentidate ion and gentisic acid.
The solubility increases observed at pH 3.5-5.0 are described by mathematical relationships involving the stability constants of some postulated complex species.
From these results, sultable formulations for use as parenteral solutions are proposed.
The increase in the apparent aqueous solubility of hexamethylmelamine in such formulations may range from five- to 90-fold, depending upon the pH and total gentisateion concentrations.
The inhibitory effect of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate on the proteolytic activity of trypsin was investigate over the pH 6-8 range.
The antitryptic activity was determined using two different substrates: casein and N,alpha-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride.
This interaction was shown to involve substrate depletion, probably involving some primary sites of the natural substrate casein.
Some inhibition was also shown to be due to an interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitior molecules.
The possible therapeutic significance of the inhibitory effect of the surfactant is discussed.
The adsorption of diphenoxylate hydrochloride, a potent antidiarrheal agent, on activated charcoal powder was studied in vitro.
Langmuir adsorption isotherms were established at pH 4 and 7, and the maximum adsorption capacity of charcoal for this drug was estimated using these values.
The antipropulsive action of diphenoxylate in the mouse was strongly inhibited in the presence of activated charcoal.
A comparative evaluation of charcoal and chromium oxide used as inert, nonabsorbable markers revealed that chromium oxide may be the marker of choic in GI transit studies in laboratory animals since it does not influence the bioavailability of diphenoxylate hydrochloride.
The binding of bile salts to cholestyramine was studied under varying conditions of pH and added electrolyte.
The taurine-conjugated bile salts were strongly absorbed by the anion-exchange resin at low pH and in the presence of chloride anions.
Glycocholic acid binding was very weak at low pH but increased strongly with increasing pH.
The presence of chloride ions strongly decreased the amount of glycocholate bound by the anion-exchange resin.
[14C]amodiaquin accumulation by washed erythrocyte preparations was characterized to permit comparisons with chloroquine accumulation.
Erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium berghei CS (chloroquine-susceptible) accumulate amodiaquin by a saturable process that has an apparent dissociation constant for amodiaquin of 7.6 X 10(-8) M and is competitively inhibited by chloroquine, quinine and quinacrine, as is the process of chloroquine accumulation.
Within experimental error, the K1 of 8 X 10(-7) M estimated for chloroquine is the same regardless of whether the drug being accumulated is [14C]amodiaquin or [14C]chloroquine.
Likewise, the K1 for amodiaquin is the same regardless of which drug is being accumulated.
In addition, glucose stimulates and hydrogen ion, cold or interruption of glycolysis inhibits amodiaquin as well as chloroquine accumulation.
These findings are evidence that a single process serves to accumulate both drugs.
In the absence of substrate, erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR (chloroquine-resistant) accumulate twice as much amodiaquin as chloroquine, and they accumulate more amodiaquin than do erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CS.
These differences occur because P. berghei CR infects polychromatophilic erythrocytes possessing a high-affinity, substrate-independent process of accumulation to which amodiaquin has greater access than chloroquine.
In the presence of glucose, amodiaquin accumulation by erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR, when plotted as a function of amodiaquin concentration in the medium, describes a sigmoid curve.
Post-mortem brain material from control and Parkinson's disease patients was examined to elucidate further the neurochemistry of this disease and to determine the mechanism of action of L-dopa as a therapeutic agent.
The activities of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (dopa D), tyrosine hydroxylase, monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase were examined; in addition the tissue levels of dopa, 3-O-methyldopa, dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were determined.
In the non-dopa-treated Parkinsonian patients, the greatest decreases were detected for striatal DA and dopa D, with homovanillic acid and tyrosine hydroxylase levels showing a lesser change.
The putamen was consistently the most severely affected region.
Dopa and 3-O-methyldopa were detectable in all brain areas only in those patients treated with L-dopa shortly before death.
The mean concentrations of DA in the striatum of these patients were 1) 9 to 15 times higher than those in non-dopa-treated patients, 2) related to the time before death of the last dose of L-dopa and 3) greater in the striatum of patients clinically classified as "good responders" as compared to "poor responders."
Although L-dopa therapy increased homovanillic acid levels in all brain areas, a preferential increase was observed in the striatum.
It was concluded that L-dopa's principal therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease are consistent with its transformation to DA in the striatum.
These experiments were designed to study the mechanism of depletion of dopamine (DA) in the striatum produced by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine (alpha-MMT).
alpha-Methyl-m-tyramine (alpha-MMTA), the metabolite of alpha-MMT, appears to be the active DA-depleting agent, since the administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor before alpha-MMT markedly reduced both the formation of alpha-MMTA and the depletion of DA.
After injection of alpha-MMT (100 mg/kg i.p.
), the striatal concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) rose by 41% at 1 hour.
This is probably due to an increase in DA metabolism, since alpha-MMT markedly enhanced the decline of DA produced by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT).
At 2, 3 and 4 hours after alpha-MMT, the concentration of HVA and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was below control level.
The decrease in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid is due partially to a decreased formation of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid from DA.
In striatal slices, both alpha-MMT and alpha-MMTA decreased the formation of 3H-H2O and the accumulation of 3H-DA from 1-3,5-3H-tyrosine.
Alpha-MMT did not alter the specific activity of 3H-tyrosine or release 3H-DA from the slices, but it did inhibit the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatal homogenates at low concentrations of tyrosine (10 muM).
At low concentrations of alpha-MMTA, the percent reduction in 3H-H2O was much greater than the percentage of 3H-DA released into the medium.
However, at higher concentrations, the inhibition of 3H-H2O reached a maximum while 3H-DA release kept increasing.
These results suggest that both inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and DA release from storage sites by alpha-MMTA may account for the depletion of DA produced by the injection of alpha-MMT.
Gastric acid responses to the test meals were measured in the Heidenhain pouch, gastric and pancreatic fistula dogs, using the intragastric titration method, and monitoring the rate at which a solution of 1-0 N-NaOH had to be added to maintain the pH of the gastric content constant at pre-selected values ranging from 5-0 to 1-0.
In this way the pH profile of the gastric acid and pepsin responses to a liver extract meal kept in the Heidenhain pouch or gastric fistula as well as to exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine could be determined.
A liver extract meal adjusted to pH 5-0 produced a potent and pressure-related stimulation of acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch without any change in secretion from the main stomach and pancreas or in the serum concentration of immuno-assayable gastrin.
Graded decrease of the liver extract meal pH to below 5-0 resulted in the pH-dependent inhibition of gastric acid output, which at pH 1-0 was only about 30% of the value attained at pH 5-0.
Acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch induced by exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine also showed gradual decrease when the pH of the pouch content was decreased in sequential order from 5-0 to 1-0.
This pH-dependent inhibition was accompanied by an increase in pepsin secretion.
The pH-dependent inhibition of the Heidenhain pouch response to the liver extract meal was not altered by topical application of a local anaesthetic and atropine or by the intravenous infusion of large doses of atropine, secretin or metiamide, which were shown to cause a marked inhibition of the main stomach response to the liver meal.
The results indicate that there is a local and gastrin-independent inhibition mechanism of gastric acid secretion activated by an acidified meal making contact with the oxyntic gland area.
The effects of tetrodotoxin and H ions were determined either by the reduction of the maximum rate of rise, VA, of action potentials evoked with threshold stimuli or in the voltage clamp by the decrease of the peak Na permeability, PNa.
With the tetrodotoxin sample used throughout the investigation the equilibrium dissociation constant, KT, of the toxin-receptor reaction at neutral pH was determined to be 2-8 nM.
Between 1-55 and 15-5 nM tetrodotoxin the normalized value, A, of VA, was found to be related to the normalized toxin concentration cT = [TTX]/2-8 nM by the empirical equation log [(1-A)/A] = 1-22 log cT-0-573.
On increasing the pH (up to 8-8) the effect of tetrodotoxin diminished as revealed by an increase in A.
The apparent reduction of cT (as calculated from A) suggests that the toxin is active only in its cationic forms.
Weakly acid tetrodotoxin solutions (7-3 less than pH less than or equal to 5-5) reduced A to a lesser degree than did neutral toxin solutions in spite of the inherent depressing effect of acid pH on A (A = 0-5 at about pH 5-5).
In more acid toxin solutions A decreased again and at pH 4-6 it was about equal to the value in toxin-free solution.
When, after equilibrium in an acid toxin solution, the perfusate was suddenly changed to neutral Ringer solution A jumped to a higher value A' as measured 1 sec after the switch.
Since the blocking effect of hydrogen ions subsided within a fraction of a second while the time constant of the toxin washout is of the order of 1 min, A' reflects the number of Na channels blocked by tetrodotoxin at acid pH.
In acid toxin-free solution the peak PNa as obtained in voltage clamp experiments was reduced by a voltage-dependent factor (cH + 1)-1 with CH = [H+]/KH(E) and KH(E) = 2-04 muM exp (0-34 EF/RT).
Adding tetrodotoxin resulted in another reduction by a constant factor p'T.
Experiments employing various combinations of toxin concentration (3-1-93 nM) and pH values (7-3-5-2) confirm the decreased toxin effect at low pH.
Moreover, p'T was smaller (the additional toxin effect larger) when the membrane had been kept depolarized and thus cH reduced during equilibration.
The experiments were done on single myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta.
The rates of toxin effect were studied either by measuring the maximum rate of rise, VA, of repetitively evoked action potentials or by measuring Na currents during periodic impulses in the voltage clamp.
VA measurements showed that in alkaline solutions (pH up to 8-8) the offset rate was unchanged while the onset was slowed in quantitative agreement with an assumed decrease in the active cationic form of tetrodotoxin.
Both VA measurements and those in the voltage clamp revealed a decrease in T'off, the offset time constant and in increase in the onset time constant, T'on, as the pH was lowered.
For tetrodotoxin concentrations, [TTX], up to 400 nM and pH values down to 5-3 the simple relation T'on/T'off = p'R held, where p'T is the constant factor by which the Na permeability was reduced at equilibrium with a given [TTX].
The agreement between kinetic and equilibrium results was also valid when, at constant [TTX] and pH.
p'T was modified by the holding potential during equilibration.
No unequivocal explanation of the results can be given but some of their features resemble acid catalysis.
A study has been made of the formation of synapses in developing reinnervated and cross-reinnervated amphibian twitch muscles which receive either a focal (iliofibularis) or a distributed (sartorius) innervation from 'en plaque' nerve terminals using histological, ultrastructural and electrophysiological techniques.
During the development of the tadpole through metamorphosis to the adult frog, the sartorius myofibres increased in length at about twice the rate of the iliofibularis myofibres, due to a fast rate of growth at their insertions on to the pelvic tendon.
The short iliofibularis and sartorius myofibres of young tadpoles (800 mum long) possessed only a single synapse and the iliofibularis myofibres did not receive any further innervation during development.
However the sartorius myofibres received further transient innervation on the new muscle laid down during development at the fast growing pelvic insertion, until the distance between the original synapse formed on the myofibres and the synapse at the pelvic end of the muscle was about 12 mm.
During development synapses possessed either skewed, multimodal, or unimodal m.e.p.p.
amplitude-frequency distributions; the intervals between m.e.p.p.s.
were not distributed randomly according to a Poisson process, as m.e.p.p.s.
of similar amplitudes tended to be separated by very short intervals; the unit-size e.p.p.
had a similar amplitude-frequency distribution as the m.e.p.p.s.
Reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of the sartorius and the iliofibularis muscles in adults or at a late stage of development simply reconstituted the normal focal and distributed innervation patterns of the muscles, as found in the control muscles of the contralateral and unoperated legs.
These observations on synapse formation in amphibia are consistent with the hypothesis that during development the axon making the initial synaptic contact on the muscle cells induces a property over a length of muscle membrane adjacent to this site which makes it refractory to synapse formation; thus during reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of adult muscles this refractory property constrains synapse formation to these sites.
In diphasic blood agar media Trypanosoma vespertilionis developed spheroid clusters as compared to rather long, sausage-shaped (sometimes branched) clusters formed by Trypanosoma dionisii.
The former species attained a greater population density (approximately 6 X 10(7) organisms/ml) than the latter (approximately 2 X 10(7) organisms/ml).
Greater numbers of epimastigotes, some in active binary divisions, were observed during the logarithmic phase of growth, and morphologic changes occurred during cultivation which correlated with increased acidity and a depletion of glucose.
Glucose concentrations decreased to 0 M in T. vespertilionis and to 4.4 X 10(-5) M in T. dionisii cultures during the stationary and death phases.
By the 12th day of incubation cultures of T. vespertilionis were more acid (pH 5.5) than those of T. dionisii vespertilionis and T. dionisii contained common and specific antigens.
At least 2-3 common antigens were detected in extracts reacted against heterologous antisera.
Specific antigens were observed as nonidentical lines formed by extracts reacted against homologous and heterologous antisera and with antisera absorbed with heterologous antigens.
At least 2 specific antigens were evident in extracts of T. vespertilionis and 1 in extracts of T. dionisii.
All the psychotropic tablets prescribed by a general practitioner in one year are itemised.
The patients who received them are separated into diagnostic groups and their treatment is analysed by the number of attendances, prescriptions, and duration of therapy.
My policy in psychiatric conditions is indicated.
Secondary and tertiary amino homologs of the title compounds have been prepared, bearing an N-isopropyl group.
N-Methyl-N-isopropyl-5,6-dihydroxytetralin exhibited marked properties consistent with its being an alpha agonist, and it is concluded that introduction of considerable bulk about the nitrogen of a catecholamine does not a priori destroy alpha-agonist effects.
The compounds qualitatively paralleled the effects of dopamine in assays based upon direct intrastriatal administration in rats, although they were less potent than dopamine.
Apparent values of Km and Vmax have been measured for catalysis of hydrolysis of unsonicated egg lecithin liposomes, activated through addition of 0.4 M n-hexanol, by phospholipases A2 from bee and snake venoms and by phospholipase C from Clostridium welchii as a function of the concentration of three surfactants: hexadecylamine, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and dihexadecyl phosphate.
For all three enzymes, values of Km and Vmax show little or no dependence on the concentration of these ionic surfactants, demonstrating that the liposomal surface charge is not a crucial factor in determining susceptibility to phospholipase-catalyzed hydrolysis.
The isolated skin of the toad Bufo marinus ictericus when impaled from the outer surface by glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl shows a voltage profile which is a continuous function of the depth of impalement.
The superficial intraepithelial potential difference measured with reference to the external solution (PDi) is negative with NaCl-Ringer's solution on both sides of the skin, displaying a minimum of -26.7+/-3.6 mV at 6+/-2 mum.
Null value is obtained at 19+/-3 mum, with positive values for deeper impalements.
Indications of cell impalements (abrupt voltage and resistance jumps) were frequently observed at sites deeper than 25 mum from the outer surface.
PDi measured at a depth of 5 mum was a logarithmic function of Na2SO4 or K2SO4 concentration in the external solution, increasing in negativity with a reduction in concentration.
Substitution of Na by K in the external solution had only minor effects on PDi.
Acidification of the external solution from pH 9 is accompanied by a reduction in the negative value of PDi.
At pH 3 PDi was positive.
PDi was interpreted as a diffusion potential at the tip of the microelectrode due to KCl diffusion from the electrode into the matrix of the stratum corneum.
Differences in K and Cl mobilities, responsible for the origin of PDi, were attributed to fixed charges in the matrix of the stratum corneum, with density and polarity determined by their degree of proponation, controlled by the hydrogen ion concentration of the external solution.
Skin potential, short-circuit current and their relationship to PDI were discussed.
The quality of ultrastructural preservation of the avian erythrocyte achieved using various fixation techniques is evaluated.
Different combinations of initial fixatives, buffers and post-fixation procedures were tested as well as variations in fixative osmolarity, pH and temperature.
Of the commonly used initial fixatives (glutaraldehyde, acrolein and formaldehyde), 2% glutaraldehyde, alone in a slightly hypertonic buffer containing divalent ions, produced optimum erythrocyte preservation.
The osmolarity was balanced using a non-electrolyte such as a sucrose.
The addition of 12% hexylene glycol to the buffer solutions also improves erythrocyte preservation, as evidenced by the increased stability of the marginal microtubules, microfilaments and proteinaceous material.
1) A study was carried out to determine the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve of stroma-free hemoglobin solution and factors which influence it, (pH; 2,3 DPG).
2) To simulate acute volume replacement, dilution experiments, in vitro, were performed employing both hemoglobin solution and Ringer's lactate in whole blood.
3) It was determined that stroma-free hemoglobin solution has a left-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve which responds to pH change but not to the addition of 2,3 DPG.
4) The dilutional effect of hemoglobin solution when mixed with whole blood in volumes up to 50% was to left-shift the oxyhemoglobin curve, unlike the effect of Ringer's lactate (no change).
5) This may have importance in the hemodynamic compensatory response to acute normovolemic anemia.
Tiny (0.2% TBS), partial thickness, non-contact radiant heat burns in guinea pigs resulted, within 3 hours, in significant edema formation and protein leakage at the site of the injury.
Areas of skin distant to the burn also showed an increase in water content but no protein leakage.
Pretreatment of the animals with either chlorisondamine hydrochloride or a mixture of methysergide and chlorpheniramine significantly decreased postburn edema formation and protein leakage.
Liquid emulsion autoradiography revealed that leakage of protein occurs primarily in the areas of skin adjacent to the panniculus carnosus.
The studies suggest that: the increase in vascular permeability that occurs as a consequence of burn injuries is humorally mediated; albumin leakage is limited to the injured tissues; and histamine, serotonin, and presumably catecholamines play significant roles in the development of this phenomenon.
The location of T4D phage-induced dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) has been determined in intact and incomplete phage particles.
It has been found that phage mutants inducing a temperature-sensitive dfr (dfrts) procude heat-labile phage particles.
The structural dfr produced by these ts mutants was shown to assume different configurations depending on the temperature at which the phage is assembled.
Morphogenesis of incomplete phage particles lacking the gene 11 protein on their baseplates was found to be inhibited by reagents binding to dfr, such as antibodies to dfr.
Further, cofactor molecules for dfr, such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, also inhibited the step in morphogenesis involving the addition of gene 11 product.
On the other hand, inhibitors of dfr, such as adenosine dephosphoribose, stimulated the addition of the gene 11 protein.
It has been concluded that the phage-induced dfr is a baseplate component which is partially covered by the gene 11 protein.
The properties of phage particles produced after infection of the nonpermissive host with the one known T4D mutant containing a nonsense mutation in its dfr gene suggested that these progeny particles contained a partial polypeptide, which was large enough to serve as a structural element.
An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity has been found associated with Uukuniemi virions.
The enzyme activity is expressed only after disrupting the virions with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and is absolutely dependent on Mn2+, whereas Mg2+ is not required, a finding that distinguishes this polymerase from those of other enveloped minus-strand RNA viruses.
Within the range pH 7.2 to 8.5 no distinct optimum was found.
The optimum temperature was between 37 and 40 C. The reaction was not inhibited by actinomycin D, rifampin, or DNase, whereas RNase was completely inhibitory.
The partially RNase-resistant product consisted of rather small-sized RNA, which contained sequences complementary to Uukuniemi virus RNA as shown by hybridization to the template L, M, and S RNA species of Uukuniemi virus.
In five of these 43 animals, the mandibles had deformities which radiography showed to be the result of dental abscesses in four cases and probably of a trauma in the other.
The absence of actinomycotic lesions of the jaw bones of these 1,226 animals, and of more than 500 examined previously, indicates that "lumpy jaw" is rare in barren-ground caribou.
The authors suggest the use of radiography to determine the nature of bone growth on skeletal remains, in the absence of soft tissues for examination for Actinomyces, either microscopically or by cultural methods.
Purified C. perfringens type A enterotoxin fed orally in an amount of 5 mg caused both vomiting and diarrhea in the monkey only when the gastric juice had been neutralized.
Exposure of enterotoxin to pH 4.0 or below rapidly destroyed the activity.
All three monkeys receiving sodium bicarbonate and 2.4 X 10(10) viable cells grown in DS medium developed diarrhea, and only one of them vomited once.
The diarrhea lasted for 13, 18 and 19 hr.
The symptoms were similar to those reported in human cases of C. perfringens food poisoning.
These results have verified the general notion that C. perfringens food poisoning should be categorized as a true "intravital intoxication".
This method may be applicable for diagnosis of human cases of C. perfringens food poisoning.
Neither enterotoxin nor anti-enterotoxin was detected in serum samples taken from any monkey up to 21 days after the challenge.
We are tempted to conclude, therefore, that no significant amount of C. perfringens enterotoxin is absorbed from the intestine.
The effect of lasting peripheral counterpulsation upon the haemodynamics and the main biochemical factors of the blood was studied in 14 dogs with intact hearts.
In cases of significant tachycardia counterpulsation in a 1:2 regimen results in only a partial reduction of the resistance to the cardiac output.
This does not always permit to prevent the formation of the phenomenon of an elevated myocardial contractility.
Slowing down of the cardiac rhythm was achieved by means of hypothermia.
In acute experiments on 92 cats anesthetized with Urethane and kept under controlled respiration the mechanism of tonic activity of the pulmonary vessels was studied in the presence of a decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli.
The tonicity of the pulmonary vessels was recorded during autoperfusion of the vessels of the posterior lobe of the left lung by means of a perfusion pump.
Simultaneously, the pressure in the common carotid artery was recorded and the oxygen saturation of the blood was measured.
Pharmacological analysis was used for the study of the mechanism of the pressor reaction of the pulmonary vessels under hypoxic hypoxy, and it demonstrated that the pression of the pulmonary vessels that develops under alveolar hypoxy is less distinct under the effect of the ganglioblocking agent Benzo-hexonium, as well as the myotropic agents Papaverine and Chloracizine.
The above reaction was significantly inhibited by the blocking agents of the D- and M-serotonin-reactive structures -- Dihydroergothamine, Morphine and Novocain, and it was completely lacking against the background of the action of Izadrine and Dimedrol -- blocking agents of serotonin- and histamine-reactive structures.
It can be supposed that the D- and M-serotonin-reactive, and probably also the histamine-reactive structures participate in the regulation of the interrelationship of ventilation and pulmonary circulation.
Using DEAE-cellulose chromatography and Agarose gel filtration we have partially purified a low Km cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) phosphodiesterase from the 100,000 X g supernatant of rat kidneys.
The characteristics of this enzyme included a Km of approximately 4 muM a pH optimum of around 8.0 and a requirement for magnesium.
This preparation should be suitable for investigation of possible effects of hormones, drugs and cellular constituents on the cyclic AMP pathway through any direct effects on the low Km enzyme.
We have also demonstrated a nonspecific, high Km cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and possibly a specific cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) phosphodiesterase in the soluble fraction from rat kidneys.
The influence of aging on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was evaluated by comparing young (20 to 30 yr) with elderly (62 to 70 yr) healthy subjects.
Despite comparable body sodium-fluid balance in the two age groups, serum renin concentration, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were lower in the elderly.
The age-related decreases in circulating renin and aldosterone concentrations were slight while subjects were supine and receiving normal sodium intake; when upright and during sodium depletion, they were more pronounced.
Inverse renin-blood pressure interrelations were noted during two of four study conditions involving normal sodium intake or mild sodium depletion (r = --0.44 and --0.47, respectively), but not during progressive sodium depletion.
Plasma renin levels were decreased in the elderly regardless of the presence or absence of an inverse relationship with blood pressure.
Aldosterone and cortisol responses to corticotropin infusion were unaltered in the elderly.
It is concluded that aging may cause a decrease in circulating renin, with parallel lowering of plasma aldosterone concentrations.
There is both clinical and experimental evidence that cellular and humoral immunity are suppressed in patients with renal insufficiency: observations in organ transplantation and in vitro stimulation of lymphocytes from uraemic patients, investigations of acute and late hypersensitivity reactions, the immune response after active immunization as well as changes of immunoglobulins and lymphatic organs in uraemia are discussed in the paper.
Lymphopenia, atrophy of the thymus gland, toxic serum factors, induction of enhancing mechanisms by certain serum fractions and metabolic defects of lymphocytes--all were shown to be involved or at least considered to be.
At present, however, it is impossible to define their rank of importance and the exact place they may occupy in the genesis of this type of "natural immunosuppression".
A new method for the measurement of renin in human plasma is described.
The method is based on the introduction of the internationally available renin standard of the Medical Research Council (MRC) London, as a calibration system.
Thus, some principal disadvantages of methods expressing results in renin reaction velocity (angiotensin generation rate) only are avoided.
Both renins, unknown and standard, react with a sheep substrate preparation and are handled identically throughout the whole procedure including the angiotensin I radioimmunoassay (RIA).
The plasma renin concentration (PRC) is given in 10(-6) MRC-renin units (muM/ml).
the renin standard is free of angiotensin, angiotensinases, and angiotensinogen; it is stable on storage.
Identical enzyme kinetics are shown for both renins.
An interference between endogenous and exogenous substrate could be avoided.
The use of an angiotensin I calibration system could be omitted.
Using a standard renin dilution from 250-0.9 muU/ml also the full biological range is covered.
When giving an unrestricted diet the preliminary normal values of PRC are 21.9 +/- 12.6 muU/ml in recumbent and 40.1 +/- 19.8 muU/ml in upright position (n = 16,x +/- s, age 20-35 years).
pH measurements in blood or in media containing either proteins or polypeptides and performed by means of micro pH combination electrodes type N 58 (Schott & Gen., Mainz) yield in a systematic error according to the regression line y = 1.135 chi - 0.842, in the range between pH 5.3 and 8.3.
This deviation from the real pH value is independent of the protein concentration and amounts to 0.1-0.2 pH units in the  physiological range.
The error does not occur if the pH measurements are performed in media which are free of proteins and polypeptides, respectively.
If the electrolyte solution within the reference electrode is replaced (NaCl solution instead of KCl solution) the error is distinctly reduced.
Glutathione plays an important role in biology and medicine.
Most cells of plants and animals contain high concentrations of reduced glutathione and a much smaller amount of oxidised glutathione.
GSH is important for several metabolic functions of live cells, e.g.
the protection of oxidative stress by peroxides, mediation of enzyme reactions, regulation of metabolic events, transport of amino acids across cell membranes via the gamma-glutamyl cycle, elimination of foreign compounds by GSH-conjugation, release of neurotransmitter substances.
Irreversible perturbations of the glutathione metabolism may be the reason for severe clinical symptoms of hemolytic anemia or, perhaps, of central nervous disease.
Current research on the effects on offspring of drinking during pregnancy has revived interest in an extremely old topic.
Observations made during England's Gin Epidemic (1720-1750) were followed by warnings of 19th-century medical writers that parental drinking could damage the fetus.
Recently a relationship between maternal drinking and abnormal morphogenesis has been again described.
Substantial and prolonged withdrawal hyperexcitability in the neural substrate for affective defense was revealed by behavioral and electrophysiological measures in cats exposed to moderate to heavy doses of alcohol for periods ranging from 6 to 72 hours.
The data are interpreted as indicating a rapid development of physical dependence on alcohol in this portion of the central nervous system.
The alcohol consumption by five genotypes of rats was studied in two experiments.
Alcohol intake was age-dependent in rats bred for high emotional reactivity and avoidance conditionability.
Differences in consumption by sex appeared to be primarily due to differences in body weight.
Acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane properties were studied at various ages in the normal human brain.
In CSF and four brain regions, the inferior olive, the cerebellar cortex, the caudate nucleus and the frontal cortex were thus beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-mannosidase, hexosaminidase and acid phosphatase biochemically quantitated at ages varying between 2 and 89 years of age.
Also the membrane latency for acid phosphatase was studied in these regions.
There appeared to exist a regional and intra-areal variation in lysosomal membrane permeability.
There was, however, no age related increase in total enzyme contents.
The late effects of various immunosuppressive insults on cell-mediated immunity in mice were studied in an attempt to assess the role of immune surveillance in the aging process.
Results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic tumor cell challenge, graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), blastogenic response to PHA, a thymus derived T cell-specific plant mitogen, and cytolytic activity against allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity.
In vivo studies late in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased in thymectomized mice, whereas those treated with cortisone, cyclophosphamide and sublethal X-ray remain unchanged.
Spleen cells from only the thymectomized and the sublethally irradiated mice show reduced activity in the GVHR.
No difference is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells.
Thus spleen cells from thymectomized or sublethally irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to PHA, whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated groups.
Furthermore, the degree of immunosuppression seen in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean life-span.
Lipoxygenase was isolated and partially purified from peanut seed by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange column chromatography.
Two had pH optima of 6.2, and the other an optimum of 8.3.
Molecular weight of each isozyme was 7.3 x 10(4), as determined by gel filtration.
The alkaline optimum isozyme was not inhibited by NaCN and was inhibited by CaCl2 except at very low concentrations.
Crassin acetate, a lactonic cembrane diterpene, has been shown to be the principal antineoplastic agent present in the marine invertebrates (gorgonians) Pseudoplexaura porosa, P. flagellosa, P. wagenaari and P. crucis.
Reported is on satisfactory results obtained with a small-size computer consisting of punching and scanning device, as well as plain writing machine in the respiratory function laboratory.
Developed in on- as well as off-line processing by an own technical staff, a diagnostic and teaching program was established for all respiratory function routine methods with the advantages of a large number of cases examined, elimination of sources of error, considerable supply of data and information, automatic documentation and filing, plain writing, interpretation and evaluation of findings.
In continuation of such works also the blood gas analysis has been included.
These values as the total of disturbances of the pathophysiological acid-base status are considered and interpreted.
Clinical correction is forced in this man-machine dialogue by automatic stops of the whole machinery before going on.
Subsequently and in addition are computer alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient, venous shunt and oxygen saturation and expressed utilizing the capacity of the small-size computer.
Experiments were carried out to define the kinetic parameters of the major phosphate transport processes of rat liver mitochondria, and to obtain information about the molecular properties of these systems.
Hydrocortisone hemisuccinate within 4 hours after in vivo administration produced an increase in precursor incoporation into rat thymus RNA and proteins in the whole animal.
From these results, together with information obtained from measurements of the tyrosine aminotransferase activity and the action of mitomycin C administered one hour before the injection of hydrocortisone, it can be concluded that the increase in tissue level of the enzyme, consequent to hydrocortisone treatment, results from an increased rate of biosynthesis of the enzyme, which participates in the catabolic processes of proteins in glucocorticoid sensitive thymus cells.
Iodoacetylphenylalanyl-tRNAPhe was used as an affinity label to localize the ribosomal components involved in the peptidyl transferase catalytic center of Escherichia coli ribosomes.
When labeling was carried out at pH 5.0, the affinity label could specifically label the ribosomal components which comprise the catalytic center.
Analysis of ribosomal proteins which had reacted with the affinity label revealed that a 30 S subunit protein, S 20, was located at or near to the ribosomal binding site of the 3'-terminus of aminoacyl- or peptidyl-tRNA.
Inhibition of acid secretion by an H2-receptor antagonist (metiamide) was assessed in three patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Metiamide (200 or 300 mg) inhibited acid secretion transiently (2 1/2 hours) by 85 to 100 per cent in all patients.
Although anticholinergic drugs alone inhibited acid secretion by only 0 to 35 per cent in these patients, the combination of metiamide and anticholinergic markedly prolonged the inhibitory effect of metiamide.
Total gastrectomy was refused by one patient, and was impossible in another; both were treated with metiamide and anticholinergic for five and 10 months.
A third patient was treated with metiamide and anticholinergic for three weeks in preparation for total gastrectomy.
Ulcer pain and diarrhea disappeared, and each gained weight.
H2-receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of some patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Histamine has a dual action on the isolated perfused ear preparation of the rabbit.
The amine induced a dose-dependent rise in perfusion pressure when the preparation was perfused with Krebs' solution.
This pressor response was reversed to a depressor effect when meypramine was added to the perfusion fluid.
This depressor effect of the amine was also dose-related.
Metiamide competitively inhibited the depressor effect of histamine.
Prior treatment of the ear vessels with metiamide alone caused an increase in histamine-induced perfusion pressure.
From these results it was concluded that the predominant pressor effect of histamine on the vascular bed of the rabbit ear is mediated through the H1-receptors and the depressor effect of the amine through histamine H2-receptors.
The rabbit pulmonary artery contains postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which meidate smooth muscle contraction; its noradrenergic nerves contain presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which mediate inhibition of the release of the transmitter evoked by nerve impulses.
Dose-response curves for the pre- and postsynaptic effects of eight alpha-receptor agonists were determined on superfused strips of the artery in the presence of cocaine, corticosterone and propranolo.
According to the concentrations which caused 20% of the maximal contraction (EC20 post), the postsynaptic rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than methoxamine.
The pA2 values of phentolamine againstoxymethazoline, phenylephrine, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and methoxamine were 7.43, 7.48, 7.59 and 7.69, respectively.
For the investigation of presynaptic effects, the arteries were preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline.
All agonists inhibited the overflow of tritium evoked by transmural sympathetic nerve stimulation.
According to the concentrations which reduced the stimulation-induced overflow by 20% (EC20 pre), the rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine.
10(-5) M phentolamine shifted the presynaptic dose-response curves for moradrenaline and oxymethazoline to the right.
The ratio EC20 pre/EC20 post was calculated for each agonist as an index of its relative post- and presynaptic potency.
Group 1 (ratio about 30: preferentially postsynaptic agonists) comprised methoxamine and phenylephrine; group 2 (ratio near 1; similar pre- and postsynaptic potencies) comprised noradrenaline, adrenaline and naphazoline; group 3 (ratio below 0.2; preferentially presynaptic agonists) comprised oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline (as well as clonidine).
Preferentially presynaptic and preferentially postsynaptic agonists had opposite effects on the basoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation.
Methoxamine and phenylephrine either did not change or enhanced, but never reduced, the response.
In contrast, oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline at low concentrations selectively inhibited the response to stimulation at low frequency (0.25-2Hz).
It is concluded that alpha-adrenoceptor agonists vary widely in their relative pre- and postsynaptic potencies, possibly because of structural differences between pre- and postsynaptic alpha-receptors.
Peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation was tested by means of hypertensive effects of the drugs following i.v.
Naphazoline (NP), oxymetazoline (OM), St 91-2-(2,6-diethylphenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--and St 1697--2-(2-ethyl, 6-methylphenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--were 3 to 5 times more potent in tthis respect thatn clonidine (CLON) whereas St 363--2-(2,4-dichlorophenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--and xylazine (XY) exerted only approx.
injection was tested by the bradycardiac effect in vagotomized rats; St 1697, St 363 and XY were active, approx.
1/10-1/30 of CLON, whereas NP, OM and St 91 were inactive.
injection of cardiovascular depression, typical for clonidine: (1) in dogs with blocked beta-adrenoceptors, the drugs facilitated the vagally meditated cardiodepressor reflex in response to baroreceptor stimulation by i.v.
injection of angiotensin; (2) in dogs treated with atropine and in (3) vagotomized cats (only NP, OM and St 363) a long lasting decrease in heart rate was observed.
Some of the experiments were complicated by increases in blood pressure, due to the "leakage" of small amounts of the highly vasopressor active drugs, from the cisternal spaces into the peripheral circulation.
The majority of results indicated, that the central cardiovascular depressor effects of the tested drugs depend on their alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulating potency and on their ability to penetrate from cerebrospinal fluid or from the blood to cardiovascular centers.
Relationships between the ability for penetration and the lipoid affinity are discussed.
Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHBA) in doses that increased the striatal dopamine (DA) content of rat brain failed to increase the affinity of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) for its pterdine cofactor or to change the sensitivity of the enzyme to the inhibition by DA.
Haloperidol (1 mg/kg) decreased the apparent Km of striatal TH for the pteridine cofactor.
However, when GHBA was injected before haloperidol it prevented the decrease in the apparent Kn of TH, in a dose related manner.
These results suggest that in striatal dopaminergic terminals the Kn of TH for the pteridine cofactor is regulated by an molecuular mechanism which requires that the impulse flow in the DA neurons is unimpaired.
Inhibiting activity of blood serum was determined from the decrease of N-acetyl-hexosamine end groups of hyaluronic acid products released by testicular hyaluronidase.
Maximum inhibition was observed within the region of pH from 6.5 to 6.8.
Correlation between the serum concentration and its inhibiting effect on hyaluronidase was found within the range of the final dilution of serum (in the reaction mixture) from 9 to 45 X.
Blood sera of cancer patients showed statistically significant increase of hyaluronidase inhibitor as compared with that of health people.
To determine the effect of changing concentrations of uremic metabolites on factors affecting oxygen transport, without the effects of extracorporeal blood pumping, we studied five patients before, during and after peritoneal dialysis.
Significant decreases in serum urea, creatinine and phosphate and increase in serum bicarbonate were not associated with changes in P50, a reflection of hemoglobin-oxygen affinity.
High erythrocyte 2,3-DPG concentrations decreased only slightly.
Arterial pO2 increased slightly as negative fluid balance was achieved.
The slight changes in oxygen transport parameters with dialysis suggest an interplay of compensatory factors and do not warrant modifying dialysis to limit the correction on acidosis or hyperphosphatemia.
Effects on hemoglobin and pO2 resulting from fluid loss can be the dominant influence of peritoneal dialysis on tissue oxygenation.
NH4Cl was infused into the left renal artery of anesthetized dogs at 50-125 mum/kg/min for up to 110 min.
Renal blood flow declined early then increased to supra-control levels during infusion.
Kidneys perfused at 125 mum/kg/min for 90 min showed patchy to confluent mixtures of cortical necrosis and tubular necrosis.
Experimental kidneys invariably showed lower urine osmolality than contralateral controls 48 h after perfusion.
Kidneys with necrosis showed depressed creatinine clearance as well.
Renal artery infusion of NH4 acetate or intravenous infusion of NaHCO3 during arterial infusion of NH4Cl prevented significant acidosis and caused minimal histological changes, but depression of urine osmolality was not prevented.
It is concluded that renal ammonium concentrations up to 40 mum/liter for 90 min does not cause tubular necrosis but does impair urine concentration.
Severe tissue damage followed renal exposure to high ammonium concentrations in the presence of metabolic or renal acidosis.
The renal papilla has a double blood supply - from both the vasa recta and the calyceal arteries.
The importance of the latter supply is not established.
A case of polyarteritis associated with papillary necrosis is reported, in which the calyceal vessels, supplying the area, show acute necrotizing arteritis and occlusion.
Clearance experiments in calcium-stone patients (n = 60) and controls (n = 60) demonstrated significantly higher urinary uric acid (UA) in younger (less 40 years) stone patients than controls (median: 480 vs. 351 mug/min) but not in older (greater than 40 years) patients.
Serum UA and urinary oxypurines were comparable in health and stone disease.
Conversely urinary phosphate was significantly lower in younger patients than matched controls (males: 224 vs. 304 mug) and presumably is responsible for the more alkaline pH.
It is suggested that calcium-stone formation in humans is represented by two different populations.
The plasma-ionized calcium levels decreased during haemodialysis when a dialysate calcium concentration of 5 mg/100 ml was used.
When dialysis was performed with a bath calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/100 ml, there was a significant increase in the plasm-ionized calcium levels in the post-dialysis period.
These results are discussed in relation of the optimal dialysate calcium concentrations and development of dialytic bone disease.
From the chemical and pharmalogical point of view it is impossible to separate strictly between antiepileptic and psychopharmalogical drugs.
Inspite of that and several clinical overlappings it is possible and helpful finding differences between the two groups of drugs.
Basing on the indication we try to demonstrate the use of these drug-groups.
Antiepileptic drugs in behaviour disorders.
Only in case of behaviour disorders due to epileptic origin antiepileptic therapy is indicated.
Psychopharmalogical drugs in epilepsies A.
The frequency of seizures may be reduced B. Psychical disorders connected with seizures may be influnced.
Each clone yielded a characteristic predominant glycoprotein which induced clone-specific immunity to trypanosome infection in mice.
Each glycoprotein consisted of a single polypeptide chain having an apparent molecular weight of 65 000 (as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and containing around 600 amino acid and 20 monosaccharide residues.
Preliminary structural studies indicated large changes in amino acid sequence dispersed over a considerable length of the polypeptide chain.
Proteolytic activity was demonstrated in semi-purified trypanosome extracts, providing one reason for the heterogeneity sometimes observed in surface glycoprotein antigen preparations.
The determination of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase by a reaction rate assay using optimal reaction conditions at 37 degrees is described.
The precision of the method has been evaluated and a reference range for normal male (less than 45 U/l) and female (less than 30 U/l) subjects determined.
Administration of cortisol to fetal rabbits resulted in a 42% inhibition of pulmonary de novo fatty acid synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) (P = less than 0.025).
This was associated with inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC.
activity (P = less than 0.01) and a tendency towards decreased activity of fatty acid synthetase.
There was no effect on pulmonary microsomal fatty acid elongation activity.
Light and electron microscopic examination of the apex of the right lung of control and cortisol-treated animals revealed changes consistent with accelerated lung maturation in the treated animals.
The in vitro activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase were similar in rabbit lung and thus acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity does not appear to be rate limiting for de novo fatty acid synthesis in lung.
No significant change in the activity of enzymes associated with de novo fatty acid synthesis of microsomal fatty acid elongation was found in fetal brain after cortisol exposure.
However, in a parallel study on fatty acid synthesis in fetal liver, cortisol administration resulted in a 30% increase in fatty acid synthetase activity (P less than 0.025).
The finding of cortisol-induced inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis in fetal rabbit lung may be related to the known inhibitory effect of cortisol on lung growth in the fetus.
ATPase activity of myosin in the heart muscle of the mouse, rat, guinea-pig, rabbit and pig was studied at neutral pH and under mild alkaline conditions.
At neutral pH the ATPase activity of myosin is inversely related to body size of the animal species.
The decrease of ATPase activity of myosin after alkaline preincubation depends on the degree of ATPase activity of intact myosin, i.e.
myosin from the heart of the mouse exhibits high ATPase activity ae same relationship was found, when comparing myosin of new-born and adult heart muscle.
It is concluded that the rate of alkaline inactivation of heart myosin is directly related to the degree of ATPase activity of intact myosin in all animals.
The responsiveness of the medullary chemoreceptors, measured by the ventilatory response to hypercapnia given in an hyperoxic gas mixture in intact anesthetized dogs has been evaluated during normothermia and at two levels of hypothermia.
The response was studied in: 1) 20 dogs during normothermia, 2) 10 of these dogs at a blood temperature of 32-33 degrees C, and 3) in the other 10 dogs during deeper hypothermia (28-29 degrees C).
The ventilatory response to CO2 decreased while blood temperature was lowered until the response became absent during deep hypothermia.
For normothermia and both levels of hypothermia a similar oxygen drive of ventilation was found which was equivalent to approximately one fourth of the spontaneous ventilation.
It is suggested, that in the deeply hypothermic animal the normal respiratory drive is apparently of peripheral (arterial) chemoreceptor origin and when this drive is nullified or significantly decreased, gentle shivering could be responsible for stimulating the respiratory center.
Metiamide an histamine H2-receptors antagonist has been used to treat a case of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome characterized by a long standing diarrhea, an important gastric hypersecretion and a moderatly elevated plasma gastrin but without digestive ulceration.
At the dose of 600 mg per day, Metiamide induced a complete suppression of acid secretion, an effect which lasted for 15 days after stopping the drug.
Accordingly and since the only finding at time of laparotomy was a small lymph node enlarged with endocrine metastatic tissue, the stomach was left intact and Metiamide pursued.
During the first 4 months of chronic administration of Metiamide, acid secretion was maintained at levels below 25 p.cent of initial values.
Ulteriorly however, although dosages of Metiamide were increased, acid hypersecretion resumed and a duodenal ulcer developed.
Total gastrectomy was then performed 11 months after the beginning of Metiamide.
In spite of the failure of Metiamide treatment, the long term follow up of this case of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, allowed us to get theoretical and practical informations.
Frequency of exercise-induced asthma has been studied in 75 unselected asthmatic patients (adults and children) by measuring the forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) and the vital capacity (VC) before and after a treadmill exercise, continued until heart rate was at least equal to 80 p.cent-85 p.cent of maximum heart rate.
In 19 subjects (25 p.cent), a more than 20 p.cent decrease from control value of FEV1 was recorded ten minutes after exercise ended.
Exercise-induced bronchial obstruction was relieved by a beta adrenergic bronchodilator aerosol inhalation.
In the group of 19 subjects having exercise-induced asthma, a significant positive correlation was found between pre-exercise FEV1 values and post-exercise FEV1 decreases.
In the whole group of 75 subjects exercise-induced asthma was related to the severity of asthma and not to other clinical or physical characteristics of the subjects.
From the data of other authors it appears that frequency of exercise-induced asthma is variable.
The authors report 5 cases of shock type anaphylactic reactions after the ingestion of glafenine.
Up to the present, acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis had chiefly been reported.
The existence of allergy to this medication remains to be proved by the wider application of allergological studies.
A double-blind study comparing betamethasone valerate and placebo aerosols was carried out in 40 patients with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis and positive skin tests to grass pollens.
Analysis of the symptoms recorded on a daily record card for a period of one month indicated that the mean monthly symptom-score was lower for all symptoms in the group on active therapy and that this reached statistical significance for the symptom of sneezing.
Significantly more antihistamine tablets were used by the placebo group as compared with the active group (p less than 0-05).
The patients' assessment of their treatment was in favour of betamethasone valerate (p less than 0-05).
No clinically significant side-effects were associated with the treatment, which was well tolerated.
Urinary acid excretion was measured in 35 human renal allograft recipients during the first few days after the onset of diuresis and two months after transplantation.
In 16 out of 17 rejection episodes an early significant decrease of renal total net H+ excretion was observed.
This urinary acidification impairment preceded the serum creatinine increase.
Only few patients showed variations in blood pH and C1-.
The acidification defect may be due to the ischaemic changes of rejection.
Adding urine to a standard buffered fibrinogen solution and then coagulating it with thrombin gives reproducible coagulation times with normal urines.
Coagulation of fibrinogen by thrombin is prolonged in acid solutions with a pH below six.
Urines of high acidity lower the buffer pH of the fibrinogen solution below a value of six thus rendering the system uncoagulable or significantly prolonging the coagulation time.
With this test system we found that out of 16 severe homograft rejections 15 were accompanied by a high acid excretion in six-hour urine specimens.
Ten of these acid episodes became apparent 12 to 48 hr before clinical symptoms and before elevation of the serum creatinine could be detected.
Inferences about the catalytic mechanism of acetylcholinesterase (acetylcholine hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.7) are frequently made on the basis of a presumed analogy with chymotrypsin, EC 3.4.21.1.
Although both enzymes are serine hydrolases, several differences in the steady-state kinetic properties of the two have been observed.
In this report particular attention is focused on the second-order reaction constant, kcat/Kapp.
While the reported pH dependence and deuterium oxide isotope effect associated with this parameter for chymotrypsin are generally consistent with simple models involving rate-limiting general acid-base catalysis, this study finds a more complicated situation with acetylcholinesterase.
The apparent pKa of kcat/Kapp for acetylcholinesterase varies between 5.5 and 6.3 for neutral substrates and involves nonlinear inhibition by [H+].
Deuterium oxide isotope effects for kcat/Kapp range from 1.1 for acetylcholine to 1.9 for p-nitrophenyl acetate.
The bimolecular reaction rate appears rate-limiting for acetylcholine at low concentrations, while a rate-limiting induced-fit step is proposed to account for apparent pKa values and low deuterium oxide isotope effects associated with low concentrations of phenyl acetate and isoamyl acetate.
The light-induced absorbance change at 518 nm of isolated chloroplasts consists of a rapid phase, and a slow phase which is complete in about 20 sec.
The slow component of the 518 nm absorbance change correlates with the light-induced change in 90 degrees light scattering at 518 nm.
Both show a similar time course, similar pH dependence with a maximum at pH 6.0, and similar sensitivity to inhibitors and to treatment of the chloroplasts with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde.
Their light minus dark difference spectra are similar with maxima at about 520 nm.
It is concluded that they are manifestations of the same phenomenon, and the slow absorbance increase at 518 nm is due to enhanced scattering.
It is proposed that the light-induced changes in scattering at 518 nm reflect alterations in selective dispersion, due to proton uptake and conformational changes in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane.
Ammonium sulfate fractionation of crude extracts of E. coli yields a soluble enzyme fraction (about 25-fold purification) that catalyzes the conversion of phiX174 single-stranded DNA to duplex DNA.
The reaction is rifampicin-resistant, requires single-stranded DNA, Mg++, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and ATP, and is stimulated by KCl.
Such soluble enzyme fractions were prepared from E. coli strains carrying the prophage mutant P1bac, in which the viral dnaB analog (ban) protein is expressed constitutively, or P1bacban, in which the expression of ban protein is prevented.
DNA-synthesizing activity of ban protein containing fractions from wild-type or dnaB(P1bac) lysogens was more temperature-resistant than that from E. coli containing only wild-type dnaB protein, whereas that from dnaB(P1bacban) lysogens of dnaB cells was extremely thermolabile.
It is suggested that the temperature-resistant DNA synthesis with fractions from P1bac lysogens is mediated by the P1 ban protein.
The intensely chromophoric intramolecular coordination complex formed between arsanilazotyrosine-248 and the active site zinc atom of azocarboxypeptidase A (Johansen, J. T. & Vallee, B. L. (1971) Proc.
Sci.
USA 68, 2532-2535) is a spectrokinetic probe of catalytic events.
The interconversion of the azoTyr-248-Zn complex and its constituents is measured by stopped-flow pH and temperature-jump methods.
The rate of interconversion, 64,000 sec-1, is orders of magnitude faster than that of the catalytic step itself (about 0.01-100 sec-1).
Rapidly turned over peptide and ester substrates disrupt the azoTyr-248-Zn complex before hydrolysis occurs.
As a consequence, formation of azoTyr-248, substrate binding, and catalysis can all be monitored while catalysis is actually in progress.
The results of these dynamic studies specify a course of catalytic events, different from those postulated based on x-ray structure analysis.
If azoTyr-248 is displaced, the direction is opposite to the inward movement postulated on the basis of x-ray studies and is not unique to induction by substrates, since rapid changes in pH also result in analogous spectral changes.
AzoTyr-248 carboxypeptidase has all the features which are essential for mechanistic studies: (1) It is enzymatically active; (2) the spectra of the metal complex differ characteristically from those of its constituents; (3) it responds dynamically to environmental factors; and (4) the response time of the probe itself is much more rapid than is required for the measurement of the catalytic step.
These combined kinetic and spectral properties of the metal complex render it a powerful spectrokinetic probe to visualize and discern microscopic details of the catalytic process.
Addition of ubiquinone-1 to E. coli ML 308-225 membrane vesicles dramatically increases coupling between NADH oxidation and active transport such that initial rates and steady-state levels of lactose and amino-acid accumulation are comparable to those observed during D-lactate oxidation.
Similar but less dramatic effects are observed with the quinone and succinate or L-lactate.
In the presence of NADH and ubiquinone-1, the vesicles also generate a membrane potential (interior negative) that is similar in magnitude to that observed in the presence of D-lactate.
Stimulation of NADH-dependent transport by ubiquinone-1 cannot be accounted for by increased rates of oxidation of NADH, and the effect of the quinone on NADH-dependent lactose transport is not observed in vesicles depleted of NADH dehydrogenase activity.
Thus, it is apparent that ubiquinone-1 shunts electrons from NADH dehydrogenase [NADH:(acceptor)oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.99.3] to the portion of the respiratory chain containing the energy-coupling site.
After lethal irradiation long-lived, immunologically vigorous C3Hf mice were produced by treatment with syngeneic fetal liver cells or syngeneic newborn or adult spleen cells.
Treatment of lethally irradiated mice with syngeneic or allogeneic newborn thymus cells or allogeneic newborn or adult spleen cells regularly led to fatal secondary disease or graft-versus-host reactions.
Treatment of the lethally irradiated mice with fetal liver cells regularly yielded long-lived, immunologically vigorous chimeras.
The introduction of the fetal liver cells into the irradiated mice appeared to be followed by development of immunological tolerance of the donor cells.
The findings suggest that T-cells at an early stage of differentiation are more susceptible to tolerance induction than are T-lymphocytes at later stages of differentiation.
These investigations turned up a perplexing paradox which suggests that high doses of irradiation may injure the thymic stroma, rendering it less capable of supporting certain T-cell populations in the peripheral lymphoid tissue.
Alternatively, the higher and not the lower dose of irradiation may have eliminated a host cell not readily derived from fetal liver precursors which represents an important helper cell in certain cell-mediated immune functions, e.g., graft-versus-host reactions, but which is not important in others, e.g., allograft rejections.
The higher dose of lethal irradiation did not permit development or maintenance of a population of spleen cells that could initiate graft-versus-host reactions but did permit the development of a population of donor cells capable of achieving vigorous allograft rejection.
These observations contribute to understanding of some of the persisting immunodeficiencies that are observed in man after fatal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation.
These results should suggest better approaches to more effective cellular engineering for correction of immunodeficiency diseases and for treatment of immunodeficiency diseases and of leukemias and malignancies of man.
During penicillin treatment of an autolysin defective mutant pneumococcus we have observed three novel phenomena: (i) Growth of the mutant cultures is inhibited by the same concentrations of penicillin that induce lysis in the wild type.
(ii) Mutant bacteria treated with the minimum growth inhibitory concentration of penicillin will lyse upon the addition of wild-type autolysin to the growth medium.
Chloramphenicol and other inhibitors of protein synthesis protect the cells against lysis by exogenous enzyme.
Sensitivity of the cells to exogenous autolysin requires treatment with penicillin or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis (e.g., D-cycloserine or fosfonomycin) since exogenous autolysin alone has no effect on bacterial growth.
(iii) Treatment with penicillin (or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis) causes the escape into the medium of a choline-containing macromolecule that has properties suggesting that it contains pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid (Forssman antigen).
Each one of these three phenomena (growth inhibition, sensitization to exogenous autolysin, and leakage of lipoteichoic acid) shows the same dose response as that of the penicillin-induced lysis of wild-type pneumococci.
On the basis of these findings we propose a new hypothesis for the mechanism of penicillin-induced lysis of bacteria.
It is suggested that inhibition of cell wall synthesis by any means triggers bacterial autolytic enzymes by destabilizing the endogenous complex of an autolysin inhibitor (lipoteichoic acid) and autolytic enzyme.
Escape of lipoteichoic acid-like material to the growth medium is a consequence of this labilization.
Chloramphenicol protects bacteria against penicillin-induced lysis by interfering with the activity of the autolytic enzyme, rather than by depleting the concentration of the enzyme at the cell surface.
Euglena gracilis contains a protein system which can utilize the reducing power of NADPH in the ribonucleotide reductase-catalyzed reduction of CTP.
The proteins required for this reaction are a flavoprotien with a molecular weight of approximately 185,000 which is functionally similar to thioredoxin reductase (NADPH), EC 1.6.4.5, and another protein (Protein I) whose function in the reaction is unknown.
This new protein does not appear to contain a prosthetic group and has a molecular weight of approximately 240,000.
In addition, the ribonucleotide reductase active in the Euglena NADPH-thioredoxin reductase system is more complex than the protein reported in a previous publication [(1974) j. Biol.
Human umbilical cord serum was found to contain both free folate and folate complexed to a high-molecular weight factor.
The complexed folate was bound to a very high affinity binder and was present in concentrations equivalent to as much as 60 ng of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid per ml of serum.
Acidification of the serum caused disassociation of the folate-binder complex.
Released folates were separated from binder by Sephadex gel filtration, zonal centrifugation through sucrose gradients, or adsorption onto activated charcoal.
The separated binding factor, either saturated or unsaturated with folate, had a molecular weight of about 40,000 on Sephadex G-200 chromatography.
Binding of [3H]pteroylglutamic acid was rapid and, as in the original endogenous folate-binder complex, was essentially irreversible at neutral pH.
The affinity and specificity of the binder were examined by competition experiments using [3H]pteroylglutamic acid and nonradioactive folate derivatives.
Oxidized folates were bound in preference to reduced derivatives, but only three to four times more unlabeled 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid than pteroylglutamic acid was required to produce an equal level of competition.
The strong affinity for 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, the main serum folate, suggests that the binder could be part of the mechanism by which the fetus concentrates maternally supplied folate for its growth and development.
The red azoTyr-248-Zn complex of arnilazocarboxypeptidase, previously used to demonstrate differences in conformation of the enzyme in crystals and in solution, has now provided means to detect multiple conformations of the enzyme in solution by stopped-flow pH and temperature jump experiments.
Er + H+ in equilibrium Ey (I), is the extremely rapid, Kfast about 10(5) sec-1, pH dependent dissociation of the metal complex.
Ey in equilibrium Ey' (II), is much slower, Kslow about 5 sec-1, pH independent interconversion of two distinct populations of protein molecules, Ey and Ey', in which the yellow azo-Tyr-248 is different conformations.
These two conformations can be differentiated readily by stopped-flow pH-jump experiments, since I is three to four orders of magnitude faster than II.
Mathematical expressions derived from this mechanism accurately predict all observations over the pH range from 6.0 to 8.5.
In a previous stopped-flow pH-jump experiment, Lipcomb and coworkers [Quiocho, F. A., McMurray, C. H. & Lipcomb, W. H. (1972), Proc.
Sci.
The present observations show that the premise for those conjectures is not valid.
The azoprobe reveals the existence of rapidly interconvertible substructures of carboxypeptidase A, and the results support the view that in solution, enzymes can adopt multiple, readily interconvertible and related conformations which could then either facilitate or impede catalysis.
In the latter case, such crystals would have greatly reduced activities and markedly altered catalytic behavior, as is observed for carboxypeptidase A.
In combination with detailed kinetic analysis of crystals, conformational analysis in solution should be a valuable guide to discern enzyme mechanisms and select crystals for x-ray structure analysis.
Norepinephrine and the enzymes involved in its synthesis and degradation were found to be associated with isolated brain microvessels.
Measurements of urinary flow rate were performed in 16 patients with established prostatitis before and after a course of antimicrobial therapy.
Before treatment the maximum flow rates were poor with abnormal flow curves and significant improvement in voiding characteristics were observed with treatment (P less than 0.01).
A preliminary electrophysiological (EMG) study of sphincter activity suggested that the obstruction to the flow of urine was at least in part due to failure of the external sphincter to relax during micturition.
Although the total number of cases in this series was small the study showed that prostatitis was associated with a disorder of micturition which correlated with the other clinical features of the disease and could be objectively evaluated.
Eradication of infection restored normal conditions in the lower urinary tract.
The experimental conditions of nonenzymatic reactivation of des-acetyl citrate lyase from K. aerogenes were studied.
It was found that at pH 8.5 0.2 MM acetyl AMP causes a fast reactivation of the enzyme.
The pH dependence of activity and the Km for citrate are very similar for both native and reactivated enzyme.
From the analysis of titration curves with hydrogen and 5-HT ions, it was found that the electrostatic interaction parameter of protein macroion and the number sites of 5-HT fixing were smaller over an acid and base pH range as compared to their values at neutral pH.
Our data were interpreted by the conformational changes which can be induced when BSA is exposed to denaturation by acid and alkali pH.
The authors describe different properties of brain mitochondrial and cell sap alanine aminotransferase.
They showed that the mitochondrial enzyme was inhibited by maleate, chlorides, acetate and phosphate with a high ionic strength (over 1.8), that its pH optimum lay between 7.5 and 8.5, that it was thermolabile at over 40 degrees C and that it was salted out from solutions with ammonium sulphate at 0.6--0.8 saturation.
The activity of the cell sap enzyme was inhibited by phosphate at an ionic strength of only 0.12, less markedly by maleate and not at all by chlorides and acetate; its pH optimum was about 8, it was thermostable up to 60 degrees C and was precipitated from ammonium sulphate solution at between 0.35 and 0.6 saturation.
The authors conclude from their results that two different alanine aminotransferase enzymes are present in the CNS.
By means of two cases of postvaccinal encephalomyelitis following antirabies vaccination has been demonstrated the meaning of these complications.
In one of these cases has been presumed a simultaneous illness of quiet rabies.
The difficulty of an aetiological diagnostic by the morphological effigy of the encephalomyelitids has been referred.
An improvement of the dispensaire-system and of the diagnostic of complications following antirabies vaccination is postulated.
Thirteen out of 18 young out-patients with simple schizophrenia under neuroleptic treatment completed a double-blind cross-over trial with Madopar [L-Dopa + benserazid (a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor)] and placebo.
Nine patients were given 900 mg L-Dopa + 225 mg benserazid daily, 1 patient received 600 mg L-Dopa + 150 mg benserazid, and 3 patients, 300 mg L-Dopa + 75 mg benserazid.
In these doses, L-Dopa was effective against emotional withdrawal, blunted affect, tendency to isolation and apathy, without inducing or aggravating productive, accessory symptoms.
The activity score, according to the specific activity-withdrawal scale, was significantly increased (P less than 0.05), whereas the total BPRS score (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) was slightly, but significantly reduced (P less than 0.05).
In cases where L-Dopa had to be limited to 600 and 300 mg daily, a tendency to anxiety, distortion of thinking, and a sense of unreality were observed, depending on the dose of L-Dopa.
In no case were gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or neurological side-effects observed.
When 3H-etorphine was administered to rats in a pharmacologically effective dose (0.75 mug/kg intracisternally), the labeled drug was concentrated in synaptic membrane fractions isolated from the brains of rats killed 10 min after etorphine injection.
Pretreatment of the animals with the narcotic antagonists naloxone, diprenorphine or l-cyclorphan, blocked the pharmacological responses to etorphine and reduced 3H-etorphine binding in the membrane fractions.
The differences between 3H-etorphine bound in synaptic membranes of rats treated with d-cyclorphan (inactive isomer) and l-cyclorphan (active antagonist) were in the same range as the reductions in etorphine binding in antagonist-treated rats, indicating that stereospecific and pharmacologically-specific binding sites in synaptic membranes in vivo were of the same magnitude: about 0.04 pmol/g brain.
In Experiment 1 the shock titration task was used to evaluate the antinoceptive properties of 5 different classes of cholinergic compounds in the rhesus monkey.
Only scopolamine and high doses of physostigmine were effective in elevating the shock threshold.
The apparent antinociceptive effect of physostigmine, however, was difficult to separate from its nonspecific behavioral depressant effect and was probably not related to an increase in cholinergic tone.
Only scopolamine (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and high doses of physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) interacted with morphine in the shock titration paradigm.
The multiplicative interaction of morphine with scopolamine was confirmed in Experiment 3 over a wider range of doses.
It was concluded that morphine and the cholinergic compounds produce antinociceptive effects through different mechanisms of the pain system.
The effects of new thienodiazepine derivatives, such as clotiazepam and Y-7131, on normal human sleep were investigated on 5 subjects and compared to those of benzodiazepine derivatives, such as diazepam and nitrazepam.
REM sleep was significantly decreased only with 2 mg of Y-7131 and rebound elevation of REM sleep did not follow in recovery 1 and 2 nights.
By using partial differential REM deprivation which was designed by us, there was also no rebound elevation of REM sleep noted in recovery 2 nights following 2 mg of Y-7131 medication.
REM sleep was not suppressed with 15 mg of clotiazepam, 6 mg of diazepam and 10 mg of nitrazepam when compared to the baseline night.
With regard to NREM sleep, stage 2 was significantly increased with 15 mg of clotiazepam and 10 mg of nitrazepam, but stage SWS was significantly decreased with 10 mg of nitrazepam.
In the first trial 20 of them received bromazepam, thioridazine, and placebo double blind cross over for 2 weeks each, and in the second trial the active agents administered to the other 20 participants were chlorpromazine and sulpiride.
The tests used were paired associate learning with nonsense syllables and digit memory span.
Before testing the subjects took either an alcoholic or a nonalcoholic bitter drink.
As in the previous study from this laboratory, alcohol was found to impair learning capacity.
Of the drugs used only bromazepam impaired learning significantly, and the combined effect of alcohol and bromazepam on learning capacity was very deleterious.
The adrenolytic effect of drugs did not correlate with their effect on learning.
Caution is necessary when prescribing bromazepam for active outpatients at least in doses used in this study.
Acute administration of nicotine hydrogen (+)-tartrate enhances the activity of rat liver tryptophan pyrrolase by a hormonal mechanism.
Chronic nicotine treatment inhibits, and subsequent withdrawal enhances, the pyrrolase activity.
The inhibition during chronic treatment is not due to a defective apoenzyme synthesis nor a decreased cofactor availability.
Regeneration of liver NADP+ in vitro and in vivo reverses the inhibition.
Chronic nicotine administration increases the liver NADPH concentration.
The above effects of nicotine resemble to a remarkable degree those previously shown for morphine, phenobarbitone and ethanol.
All effects are compared, and their possible significance in relation to drug dependence is discussed.
The etioplasts of dark-grown bean leaves showed ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) activity which had a pH optimum of 8.5, was stimulated by dithiothreitol and unaffected by light-triggering.
Bean chloroplasts showed a low activity of dark-induced ATPase with a pH optimum of 8.5 and a substantial amount of light-triggered activity with a pH optimum of 8.0.
The light-triggered activity depended on dithiothreitol and Mg2+ and was promoted by phenazine methosulphate.
Light-triggered ATPase activity was completely inhibited by 20mum-dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide.
During the 48 h of light-induced greening of dark-grown leaves there was a 70% increase of the chloroplast ATPase activity found after light-triggering and a 30% fall in the dark-induced activity, both expressed on a per leaf basis.
As the larger part of these changes occurred during the first 30 min of illumination, it is concluded that most or all of the chloroplast ATPase was present in the etioplast, a conclusion identical with that of Lockshin et al.
During 48 h of greening there was a tenfold increase in the amount of thylakoid membrane in the leaf together with an 83% fall in the ATPase activity per m2 of thylakoid membrane, measured after light-triggering.
The isolation is described of pure cultures of three non-methane-utilizing methylotrophic bacteria which, together with the previously described Bacillus PM6, have a very limited range of growth substrates; these organisms are designated "restricted facultative' methylotrophs.
Two of these isolates, W6A and W3A1, grow only on glucose out of 50 non-C1 compounds tested, whereas the third isolate S2A1 and Bacillus PM6 grow on betaine, glucose, gluconate, alanine, glutamate, citrate and nutrient agar, but not on any of a further 56 non-C1 compounds.
Crude sonic extracts of trimethylamine-grown and glucose-grown W6A and W3A1 isolates, and of trimethylamine-grown C2A1 (an obligate methylotroph) contain (i) no detectable 2-oxogltarate dehydrogenase activity, (ii) very low or zero specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase and (iii) NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity.
Extracts of trimethylamine-grown PM6 and S2A1 methylotrophs have (i) very low 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase specific activities, (ii) comparatively high specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase and (iii) NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity but no NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity.
The activities of most of these enzymes are increased during growth on glucose, alanine, glutamate or citrate, but only very low 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activities are present under all growth conditions.
The restricted facultative methylotrophs grow on certain non-C1 compounds in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and, in some cases, of other enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle; these lesions cannot therefore be the sole cause of obligate methylotrophy.
Stearic acid desaturase activity was assayed in preparations from perigenital adipose tissue and liver from lean and genetically obese female mice (ob/ob).
The total activity in the perigenital adipose tissue from obese mice was threefold greater than in the tissue from lean mice, but per g of adipose tissue the activity was twofold greater in tissue from lean mice.
In liver, the activity in obese mice was elevated at 8 weeks of age, remained elevated up to 24 weeks and then decreased by half at 48 weeks, but at all ages was higher than that in lean mice.
The decrease in desaturase activity of liver from obese mice at 48 weeks corresponded to a change in the fatty acid composition of liver lipids toward that found in lean mice.
Whereas in adipose tissue much of the increased enzyme activity may be due to tissue hyperplasia, in liver it is mainly an increased activity per cell.
Noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of guinea-pig brain synaptic membranes incubated in sodium phosphate buffer.
In the presence of 1 mm-NaF, noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of oleate into the choline glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylinositol, ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid of synaptic membranes incubated in 10 mm-Tris-HCl buffer.
In Tris-CHl containing 1 mm-NaF, stimulation of incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids by noradrenaline was enhanced by ATP, CaCl2, MgCl2 and CoA plus dithiothreitol.
The optimum concentration of CaCl2 for stimulation by 10 mum-noradrenaline was 10 mum.
In the presence of CaCl2, the optimum concentration of ATP-2MgCl2 was in the range 0.1-1 mm.
Acetylcholine, carbamoylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, histamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid also stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of synaptic membranes.
Sigmoidal dose-response curves were obtained, similar to those obtained previously for stimulation by the same agonists of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase A2 (Gullis & Rowe, 1975a).
The initial rate of transfer of oleate from oleoyl-CoA to choline glycerophospholipid was similar to the initial rate of transfer from oleate-albumin, stimulated by noradrenaline.
Transfer of oleate from oleoyl-CoA was not appreciably stimulated by noradrenaline, but was stimulated by ATP and MgCl2.
The binding of Mg2+ to the wall teichoic acid of Lactobacillus buchneri N.C.I.B.
8007 was measured by equilibrium dialysis at controlled ionic concentration and pH.
In an aqueous solution containing 10mM-NaCl at pH 5.0 one Mg2+ ion was bound for every two phosphate groups of the teichoic acid, with an apparent association constant, Kassoc.
= 2.7 x 10(3) M-1.
On lowering the pH below the pKa of the phosphate groups the amount of bound Mg2+ decreased concomitantly with decreasing ionization of the phosphate groups.
Both the amount of Mg2+ bound to the teichoic acid and the apparent association constants were similar in the presence of 10 mM concentrations of NaCl or KCl but decreased markedly in the presence of 10 mM-CaCl2 because of competition between Ca2+ and Mg2+ for the binding sites.
A similar effect was found when the concentration of NaCl was increased from 0 to 50 mM.
The results are discussed in relation to the function of teichoic acid in the walls of Gram-positive bacteria.
To identify the functional groups that are involved in the conversion of beta-glycerophosphate by alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) from pig kidney, the kinetics of alkaline phosphatase were investigated in the pH range 6.6-10.3 at substrate concentrations of 3 muM-30 mM.
From the plots of log VH+ against pH and log VH+/KH+m against pH one functional group with pK = 7.0 and two functional groups with pK = 9.1 were identified.
Another group with pK = 8.8 was found, which in its unprotonated form catalyses substrate conversion.
GSH inhibits the alkaline phosphatase reversibly and non-competitively by attacking the bound Zn(II).
The influence of the H+ concentration on the activation by Mg2+ ions of alkaline pig kidney phosphate was investigated between pH 8.4 and 10.0.
The binding of substrate and activating Mg2+ ions occurs independently at all pH values between 8.4 and 10.0.
The activation mechanism is not affected by the H+ concentration.
A scheme is proposed for the reaction between enzyme, substrate, Mg2+ and H+ and the overall rate equation is derived.
The mechanism of substrate binding and splitting by the functional groups of the active centre is discussed on the basis of a model.
Mg2+ seems to play a role as an autosteric effector.
The pH-dependence of the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by beta-lactamase I (penicillinase, EC 3.5.2.6) was studied.
Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin (6-[D(-)-alpha-aminophenylacetamido]penicillanic acid) were used.
and kcat./Km for both substrates gave bell-shaped plots of parameter versus pH.
The pH-dependence of kcat./Km for the two substrates gave the same value (8.6) for the higher apparent pK, and so this value may characterize a group on the free enzyme; the lower apparent pK values were about 5(4.85 for benzylpenicillin, 5.4 for ampicillin).
and kcat./Km depended on pH in exactly the same way.
The value of Km for benzylpenicillin was thus independent of pH, suggesting that ionization of the enzyme's catalytically important groups does not affect binding of this substrate.
The pH-dependence of kcat.
for ampicillin differed, however, presumably because of the polar group in the side chain.
The hypothesis that the pK5 group is a carboxyl group was tested.
Three reagents that normally react preferentially with carboxyl groups inactivated the enzyme: the reagents were Woodward's reagent K, a water-soluble carbodi-imide, and triethyloxonium fluoroborate.
An enzyme system from Datura innoxia roots oxidizing formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was purified 38-fold by conventional methods such as (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, negative adsorption on alumina Cy gel and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose.
The purified enzyme was shown to catalyse the stoicheiometric oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester to benzoylformic acid ethyl ester and formic acid, utilizing molecular O2.
Substrate analogues such as phenylacetaldehyde and phenylpyruvate were oxidized at a very low rate, and formylphenylacetonitrile was an inhilating agents, cyanide, thiol compounds and ascorbic acid.
This enzyme was identical with an oxidase-peroxidase isoenzyme.
The oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was also catalysed by horseradish peroxidase.
The oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was different from other peroxidase-catalysed reactions in not being activated by either Mn2+ or monophenols.
The oxidation was inhibited by several mono- and poly-phenols and by catalase.
A reaction mechanism for the oxidation is proposed.
2-Oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase was purified from sheep liver and gave one band on polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis.
The enzyme was completely dependent for its activity on the presence of Tris or one of a number of related amines, all of general structure: (See article).
When more than one R group was hydrogen no enzyme activity was observed.
Only one of these amines is known to exist in living tissues and large concentrations of all amines were required for maximum activity.
L-2-Aminopropan-1-ol was the most effective amine on the basis of substrate Km and Vmax.
The enzyme was activated by phosphate which lowered the Km values for methylglyoxal, amine and NAD+.
The pH optimum of the enzyme was 9.3 and there was no activity at pH values below 7.8.
A search for activators that might produce activity at pH 7.4 proved unsuccessful.
The enzyme was inhibited by rather large concentrations of barbiturates (6-46 mM) and nitro-alcohol analogues of the activating amines (66-139 mM).
A number of parameters affecting the adsorption of rRNA and poly(A)-containing RNA to Millipore filters were investigated separately.
Binding of both types of RNA to the filter was dependent on the concentration of RNA, pH and Mg2+ concentration of the reaction mixture.
Both types of RNA bound to the filter optimally at slightly acid pH values.
The binding of poly(A)-containing RNA to the filter exhibited a broad pH-dependence compared with that of rRNA.
The ratio of poly(A)-rich RNA/rRNA retained by the filter was maximal between pH7 and 8.
The presence of 1 mM-EDTA or a high concentration of NaCl (over 0.5M) decreased the affinity of RNA for the filter.
The amount of poly(A)-containing RNA in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of a plasmacytoma cell line (MPC-11) labelled with [32P]Pi was determined by the Millipore-filter technique under conditions that minimized contamination by rRNA.
These data were compared with the estimations made by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography.
The results obtained by these two methods were in good agreement for RNA labelled for short periods (up to 2h).
In long labelling and pulse-chase experiments, however, contamination of the filter by rRNA of increasing specific radioactivity in the cytoplasm gave an erroneous value for poly(A)-containing RNA by the Millipore-filter technique.
Determinations made on the nuclear fraction by these two methods did not show significant variation in short- and long-term labelling experiments.
The NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase of Neurospora crassa was digested with trypsin, and peptides accounting for 441 out of the 452 residues of the polypeptide chain were isolated and substantially sequenced.
Additional experimental detail has been deposited as Supplementary Publication SUP 50052 (11 pages) with the British Library (Lending Division), Boston Spa, Wetherby, W. Yorkshire LS23 7BQ, U.K., from whom copies may be obtained under the terms given in Biochem J.
The extracellular proteinase of Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 was used to digest the NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase of Neurospora crassa.
The sequences obtained were valuable in providing overlaps for the alignment of about two-thirds of the sequences found in tryptic peptides [Wootton, J. C., Taylor, J, G., Jackson, A.
A., Chambers, G. K. & Fincham, J. R. S. (1975) Biochem.
The blocked N-terminal peptide of the protein was isolated.
This peptide was sequenced by mass spectrometry, and found to have N-terminal N-acetylserine by Howard R. Morris and Anne Dell, whose results are presented as an Appendix to the main paper.
The staphylococcal proteinase showed very high specificity for glutamyl bonds in the NH4HCO3 buffer used.
No cleavage of glutaminyl or S-carboxymethylcysteinyl bonds was found.
Additional experimental detail has been deposited as Supplementary Publication SUP 50053 (5 pages) with the British Library (Lending Division), Boston Spa, Wetherby, W. Yorkshire LS23 7BQ, U.K, from whom copies may be obtained under the terms given in Biochem.
Peptic and chymotryptic peptides were isolated form the NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase of Neurospora crassa and substantially sequenced.
Together with the tryptic peptides [Wootton, J. C., Taylor, J. G., Jackson, A.
A., Chambers, G. K. & Fincham, J. R. S. (1975) Biochem.
149, 749-755], these establish the complete sequence of the chain, including the acid and amide assignments, except for seven places where overlaps are inadequate.
These remaining alignments are deduced from information on the CNBr fragments obtained in another laboratory [Blumenthal, K. M., Moon, K. & Smith, E. L. (1975), J. Biol.
Further information has been deposited as Supplementary Publication SUP 50054 (17 pages) with the British Library (Lending Division), Boston Spa, Wetherby, W. Yorkshire LS23 7BQ, U.K., from whom copies may be obtained under the terms given in Biochem.
The activities of citrate synthase and NAD+-linked and NADP+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases were measured in nervous tissue from different animals in an attempt to provide more information about the citric acid cycle in this tissue.
This suggests that in higher animals the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction is far-removed from equilibrium.
If it is assumed that isocitrate dehydrogenase activities provide an indication of the maximum flux through the citric acid cycle, the maximum glycolytic capacity in nervous tissue is considerably greater than that of the cycle.
This suggest that glycolysis can provide energy in excess of the aerobic capacity of the tissue.
The activities of glutamate dehydrogenase are high in most nervous tissues and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase are high in all nervous tissue investigated.
However, the activities of alanine aminotransferase are low in all tissues except the ganglia of the waterbug and cockroach.
In these insect tissues, anaerobic glycolysis may result in the formation of alanine rather than lactate.
Activity of 5-aminolaevulinate synthetase was measured in the midgut and other tissues of the last larval instar of the southern armyworm (Spodoptera eridania Cramer, formerly Prodenia eridania Cramer).
Optimum conditions for measuring the activity were established with respect to all variables involved and considerable differences from those reported for mammalian enzyme preparations were found.
Maximum activity (20 nmol/h per mg of protein) occurs 18-24 h after the fifth moult and thereafter decreases to trace amounts as the larvae age and approach pupation.
Synthetase activity was rapidly induced by oral administration (in the diet) of pentamethylbenzene, phenobarbital, diethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridine-3, 5-dicarboxylate, and 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide.
Induction of 5-aminolaevulinate synthetase correlated well with the induction of microsomal N-demethylation of p-chloro-N-methylaniline, except for phenobarbital, which induced the microsomal oxidase relatively more than the synthetase.
Reaction of phenacetin with N2O4 in glacial acetic acid at 10(0) C gives N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide.
This N-nitrosoacylarylamine is stable at low temperatures (--30 degress C) but unstable at ambient temperature.
No intact N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide can be detected when phenacetin is nitrosated under conditions simulating those in the stomach (37 degrees C, pH 1).
Instead, 2-nitro-4-ethoxybenzenediazonium chloride is the main reaction product found.
Trapping of the diazonium ion with 1-naphthol as an azo dye provides a useful means to identify the parent N-nitroso compound and to measure colorimetrically its rate of formation.
Preliminary results of animal experiments show that the N-nitroso compound is a directly acting carcinogen.
The effect of (4-acetamido-phenyl)-2-acetoxy-benzoate (benorilate, Benortan) on the inflammatory process was studied thermographically and histologically in cotton-pellet tests on rats.
Following implantation of the cotton-pellet, thermography shows a clear inhibition of the local inflammation due to treatment with benorilate.
Histological examination shows a corresponding influence of benorilate upon the proliferative phase of the inflammation.
The success of antiphlogistic therapy is in correlation with the time of medication.
Fifteen acidic antiinflammatory agents, for which some clinical data have previously been published, have been examined for their potency in the carrageenan-induced rat foot edema test, and for their acidity (pKa) and partition coefficients.
Published serum half-life data and daily clinical (anti-arthritic) dose have been tabulated for these drugs and correlations between these various parameters are discussed.
The rat foot edema carrageenan test has proved to be a fairly reliable predictor of clinical dose for most acidic antiinflammatory agents of moderate serum half-life.
From testing a new benzodiazepine derivative, 8-chloro-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-one (Bu 1014), as measured against a placebo in a double-blind trial, the following conclusions can be drawn.
The test was carried out over two periods of a fortnight each with a change-over between the two periods.
The change-over method has proven suitable to reveal side effects of the substance which last for at least two weeks.
Owing to the substance's sequelae, however, statistical analysis of the second treatment period's information is not possible with this experimental design.
The statistical methods used proved more effective than the usual methods as they allow clearer statements to be made on the efficacy of the substance.
Within the first period of 14 days both the group receiving the placebo and the drug treated group showed a decrease in the intensity of anxiety.
The sequelae of Bu 1014 can be described as an increase in restiveness and anxiety in those patients who received the placebo in the second treatment period.
The following assay methods for pharmacokinetic studies on flavoxate (F) and on its main metabolite, i.e.
Spectrophotometry for the assay of F and of A in plasma, 2.
TLC-Spectrodensitometry and GLC for the assay of A in urine after acid hydrolysis, 3.
TLC-Spectrodensitometry for determining the F : A ratio in plasma or in urine.
It was found that F hydrolyzes into A.
This process depends on the pH and on the medium.
In water, at pH 5.0, F is stable, while in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 the semi-hydrolysis time is 60 min.
In a solution with bovine serum albumin, in rat, rabbit, dog or human plasma the semi-hydrolysis times are between 5 and 60 min.
Finally the plasma-red cells repartitions of F and of A were studied in vitro in rat, rabbit, dog and human blood and found between 0.8 and 2.0 for F and between 2.1 and 4.6 for A.
The substance 9,10-dihydro-10-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-9-anthrol (WA 335) was examined for its antagonistic effects against histamine and serotonin, for its atropine-like properties as well as for a series of other qualities in comparison with cyproheptadine and pimethixene.
The anti-histamine and anti-serotonin activities of compound WA 335 on the smooth muscle and the capillary do not only exceed that of cyproheptadine but also that of pimethixene.
WA 335 shows an extremely strong binding to histamine and serotonin receptors.
In the dose range in which it causes already an antamine effect, its oral absorption is very good.
The anti-anaphylactic effect is much stronger than that of cyproheptadine.
Like pimethixene and cyproheptadine, WA 335 has no distinct antagonistic qualities against bradykinin.
In examinations on the bronchus of the guinea pig and the pupil of the mouse, the atropine-like efficiency corresponds to that of cyproheptadine; it is stronger on the stimulated vagus of the cat and less efficient than cyproheptadine on the stomach of the rat.
WA 335 has distinct central atropine-like properties.
In contrast to pimethixene, compound WA 335 like cyproheptadine potentiates the effects of norepinephrine in cats.
The reduction of the carotid sinus reflex in the cat is more distinct after WA 335 than after pimethixene and corresponds to that produced by cyproheptadine.
The influence on body temperature in the rat is similar to that of cyproheptadine.
WA 335 is equally efficient as pimethixene with regard to the inhibition of spontaneous motility and prolongation of barbiturate sleep in mice, and shows the same anti-emetic activity as does chlorpromazine in dogs.
In contrast to chlorpromazine the behaviour of dogs and cats is distinctly altered already by doses of WA 335 which cause a slight sedation.
In rats and mice the serotonin and histamine antagonistic drug 9,10-dihydro-10-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-9-anthrol (WA 335-BS) caused stronger central sedative effects than did cyproheptadine.
WA 335-BS also displayed stronger activity against reserpine- and central tremorine-induced effects than did cyproheptadine and it slightly enhanced d-amphetamine-induced effects: therefore it may have antidepressant properties.
WA 335-BS proved to be very effective against isolation-induced aggression in male mice.
Like cyproheptadine, WA 335-BS increased food consumption in cats.
In EEG-experiments in the conscious rabbit the serotonin-antagonistic drugs WA 335-BS and cyproheptadine exerted stronger depressant activity on the arousal reactions than did the neuroleptic chlorpromazine.
The results of our animal studies suggest WA 335-BS to be an antidepressant with sedative properties.
Following oral administration of 4-acetamido-phenyl-2-acetoxybenzoate (carboxyl-14C) (benorylate) to rats, no gross differences were detected 7.5 h after administration with respect to the distribution of 14C in various tissues, including the upper sections of the small intestine.
A high concentration of 14C was found in the lower sections of the intestine 4 h after administration.
The 14C in the intestine was present as unchanged benorylate, as detected by thin-layer chromatography, suggesting that benorylate absorption was slow.
Intravenous injection of 14C-benorylate to rats showed that the drug had a relatively high elimination rate from the blood with a half-life of 1.9 h. In blood benorylate must be rapidly hydrolysed enzymatically since no 14C-metabolites, other than salicylic acid, could be detected.
Effects of 3 kinds of parasympatholytic drugs (timepidiumbromide, hyoscine-N-butylbromide and prifinium-bromide) and placebo (physiological saline solution) on the gastrointestinal tract were evaluated roentgenographically by double blind technique in a total of 101 male human subjects.
The results may briefly be summarized as follows: 1.
There were significant differences on hypotonic rate being one of the indexes of the gastric tonus between timepidium-bromide and placebo.
The effects of 3 experimental drugs were significantly high as compared with that of placebo on peristaltic movement of the stomach.
The effect of timepidium-bromide was significantly different from that of placebo on the site of arrival of barium.
The comparison of degrees of the gastric tonus between main and control tests revealed that the effect of placebo obtained in the main test was significantly inferior to that of hyoscine-N-butylbromide obtained in the control test, whereas there existed no significant differences of the effects among 3 active drugs.
Effects of each drug on the gastric tonus which was scored by hypertonic, normotonic and hypotonic state were evaluated by stratification.
The result showed that the effect of timepidium-bromide was significantly greater than that of placebo.
All active drugs were not significantly different in terms of 7 observed values each on the gastric form.
7 patients suffering from severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency have been treated with a lipolytic enzyme extracted from Rhizopus arrhizus.
Comparing the fungal lipase with a placebo the drug lowered the daily stool weight from 809 g to 443 g on an average, i.e.
The steatorrhea was reduced from 75.6 g/24 h to 32.9 g, i.e.
When incubating the enzyme in vitro in saline solutions of different pH for 1 h the loss of lipolytic activity is 13% at pH 5, 15% at pH 4, and 19% at pH 3.
So the enzyme, like fungal proteases, is almost not altered by hydrochloric acid at concentrations found physiologically in the stomach.
During the submerged cultivation of Bacillus thuringiensis var.
thuringiensis in 300- and 3000-liter fermentors, lysis occurred at the end of the exponential phase of growth.
At time of lysis, the amount of soluble sugar was 1-12 g/liter, pH value dropped to 5.3-5.8 from the original PH 6.8 and started to rise after all the cells had lysed.
The proteolytic activity was low during the lysis and increased as the sporulation commenced.
However, when these same strains were coupled with certain other living bacteria or certain sterile bacterial extracts, lesions developed from which corroding bacilli could be isolated even after 21 days.
Four distinct peptide hydrolases (EC 3-4) have been characterized in guinea-pig epidermis; these are cathepsin B1, cathepsin C, cathepsin D and arylamidase.
Cathepsin E was not detected.
The solubility of fatty acids in aqueous media containing bile salts alone and in admixture with either lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) or phosphatidylethanolamine was determined.
Over the pH range 2-0-7-4, the order of fatty acid solubility in aqueous solutions containing bile salts was linoleic greater than oleic greater than elaidic greater than palmitic greater than stearic.
The solubility of each fatty acid increased as the pH of the miceus solutions of bile salts greatly increased the solubility of palmitic acid and stearic acid.
In the presence of bile salts and lecithin, the solubility of oleic acid and elaidic acid decreased with increasing pH of the micellar solution, indicating a competitive effect between the fatty acid anions and lecithin.
Phosphatidylethanolamine as an additive to bile salts increased the solubility of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the pH range 2-3-7-4.
The effectiveness of phosphatidylethanolamine as an amphiphile was similar to that of lecithin, although at pH 3.0 fatty acid solubility was greater in the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine.
The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the intestinal absorption of fatty acids in sheep.
The solubility of fatty acids in aqueous solutions containing bile salts and lysolecithin at pH values between 2-0 and 7-4 was studied.
The influence of the products of phospholipolysis of lecithin on palmitic acid solubility was determined.
On a molar basis, lysolecithin was more effective than were bile salts in promoting the solubilization of the fatty acid.
In bile salt solutions in which the phospholipid concentration was constant on a molar basis, in solubility of palmitic acid decreased linearly with the progressive replacement of lecithin by lysolecithin.
Palmitic acid was solubilized to the same extent on replacing lecithin with lysolecithin on a constant weight basis.
In bile salt solution containing lysolecithin and oleic acid in equimolar amounts, the solubility of palmitic acid was similar to that in bile salt solution containing lecithin in equivalent proportion.
The low molecular weight folate binding protein (FABP) has been purified 1000-fold to a specific activity of 7.2 gamma g of pteroylglutamic acid (PGA) bound per mg of protein.
This purified FABP represents two protein bands that bind PGA on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoreis, elutes from DEAE-cellulose in 0.001 M phosphate buffer, stains positive with PAS, Elutes from concanavalin A Sepharose affinity columns with methyl alpha-mannoside, and shows three major peaks (pl =6.8, 7.5, 8.2) by isotric focusing.
The binding of PGA to purified FABP dependent on pH and is inhibited by urea...
Two immunoglobulins, IgA(K) and IgG(K), were isolated from the serum of a single patient with two monoclonal components (biclonal proteins).
After chain separation, the light chains from each molecule were found to be identical by the following criteria: electrophoretic mobilities under various pH and dissociating conditions, amino acid compositon, fingerprint analysis of tryptic peptides and of 14C-succinylated chymotryptic peptides, and amino acid sequence of the N-terminal 40 residues.
The heavy chains were indistinguishable for the N-terminal 45 amino acid residues.
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a single heavy chain variable (VH) region may be associated with two different heavy chain constant (CH) genes.
As shown previously, proteinases frequently associated with plasma albumin samples catalyze a very limited and specific cleavage of the albumin molecule when it exists in the F conformational state near pH 3.7.
The primary proteolytic product, BPA, has a molecular weight similar to or identical with that of the parent protein but yields two large fragments of molecular weight approximately 46000 and 23000 on reduction.
Evidence is presented here that cleavage occurs within the disulfide loop between Cys390 and Cys434 with no detectable loss of small peptides, the amino acid composition of BPA being identical with that of the parent protein within experimental error.
Cleavage exposes a new amino-terminal phenylalanine residue and may occur at the Glx392-Phe393 bond although the possibility exists that it occurs at another X-Phe bond in the unsequenced region of residues 400-402.
The damaged protein has a somewhat altered secondary structure as judged from optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism measurements, probably an approximate 15% loss in helicity.
The hydrodynamic volume is increased by approximately 20%.
However, various physical studies indicate the tertiary structure to be strikingly similar to that of the native protein.
Of most significance is the fact that the protein still undergoes the N-F and N-B transitions, although in both cases they occur at somewhat more moderate pH than in the parent protein.
Moreover a sensitivity of the N-B transition to Ca2+ is still seen and binding behavior toward the dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid is essentially unaltered.
The results are best understood in terms of the concept of a multidomain structure which has been suggested frequently for plasma ablumin.
Extracts of acetone-ether powders of bovine thoracic aorta contain lipase activity which has an alkaline pH maximum (7.8-8.4) and is stimulated 4-10-fold by adding serum or isolated apolipoprotein-glutamate to the assay mixture.
Serum activation is completely reversed by isolated apolipoprotein-serine or apolipoprotein-alanine.
Lipolysis is strongly inhibited by NaCl (0.5 M) and protamine sulfate (1 mg/ml) and partially inhibited by heparin.
Based on these characteristics, the lipase is identified as lipoprotein lipase.
Purine nucleotide pyrophosphotransferase was purified to apparent homogeneity from a culture filtrate of Streptomyces morookaensis.
It is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 24 000-25 000, and its isoelectric point is 6.9.
The enzyme synthesizes purine nucleoside 5'-phosphate (mono, di, or tri) 3'-diphosphates such as pppApp, ppApp, pApp, pppGpp, ppGpp and pppIpp by transferring a pyrophosphoryl group from the 5'-position of ATP, dATP and ppApp to the 3'-position of purine nucleotides.
The purified enzyme catalysed the formation of 435 mumol of pppApp and 620 mumol of pppGpp from ATP and GTP per min mg protein under the standard conditions.
The enzyme requires absolutely a divalent cation for activity, and optimum pH for the enzyme activity lay above 10 for Mg2+, for Co2+ and Zn2+ from 9 to 9.5, and for Fe2+ from 7.5 to 8.
The enzyme is inhibited by guanine, guanosine, dGDP, dGTP, N-bromosuccinimide, iodacetate, sodium borate and mercuric acetate.
A protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37) which phosphorylates histones was purified partially from the soluble fractions of cultured plant cells.
The optimum pH was 7.5 to 9.0.
The activity wasnot stimulated by exogeneous cyclic AMP.
It was thermolabile and completely dependent on the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity.
p-Chloromercuribenzoate inactivated this enzyme and this inactivation was overcome by mercaptoethanol.
Adenosine triphosphate : nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.1) has been purifiec approximately 3500-fold from an extract of pig liver nuclei to a specific activity of 40 mumol of NAD+ per min per mg protein.
The enzyme was found to have a molecular weight of 203 000, a frictional ratio of 1.6 and an isoelectric point of approximately 5.
Porcine pancreas synthesizes a prephospholipase A2 which occurs in a 5 : 95 ratio compared with the more abundant zymogen of the same enzyme (phosphatide-acylhydrolase; EC 3.1.1.4).
These two prephospholipases could be well separated by CM-cellulose chromatography.
The most striking differences were the loss of one histidine and one methionine in the isoenzyme, corresponding to residues 24 and 27, respectively, in alpha-phospholipase A2.
The positional and stereo specificity of both enzymes are the same, but the specific activity of the beta-phospholipase A2 is lower.
The molecular weight of the isoenzyme was estimated to be about 14 000, while the isoelectric points were 5.1 and 5.9 for the isoprecursor and active isoenzyme, respectively.
The existence of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.-) was demonstrated in silkworm larva by gel filtration of the homogenate.
The cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase was separated from cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases by column chromatography on hydroxyapatite and Sephadex G-200.
The enzyme has a molecular weight of approx.
260 000, and optimum pH of 8.3 and a Km value of 2 muM.
The enzyme is activated by 5 mM of Mg2+ and 2 mM of Mn2+.
The cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity was greatly inhibited by low concentrations of cyclic IMP but to a lesser extent by cyclic AMP even at a high concentration.
The activity was also inhibited by caffeine and theophylline.
(11 Cell extracts and extracellular culture fluids of species of the yeast genus Schizosaccharomyces exhibited exo-beta-(1 leads to 3)- and exo-beta-(1 leads to 6)-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.-) activities.
(2) Using a combination of Sephadex G-100 and DEAE-cellulose chromatography, the exo-beta-(1 leads to 3)-glucanases from the cell extracts and culture fluid of Schizosaccharomyces japonicus var.
(3) The purified enzymes hydrolysed the beta-(1 leads to 6)-glucosidic linkage in addition to the beta-(1 leads to 3) linkage.
Heat denaturation, inhibition and electrophoretic studies indicated that both hydrolytic activities were properties of a single protein.
The Km and V for laminarin hydrolysis were 6.25 mg/ml and 350 mumol of glucose released/min/mg protein, and for pustulan they were 166 mg/ml and 52 mumol of glucose released/min/mg protein.
(4) The exo-beta-glucanase was assigned a molecular weight of 43 000.
(5) the purified enzyme failed to hydrolyse isolated cell walls from either baker's yeast or Schizosaccharomyces pombe or to induce protoplast formation from intact cells of S. japonicus var.
Maltohexaose producing amylase (EC 3.2.1.-) is the fourth known exo-amylase, the three previously known being glucoamylase, beta-amylase and Pseudomonas stutzeri maltotetraose producing amylase.
The enzyme after release from Aerobacter aerogenes cells by 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate extraction was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration to 80-fold of the original sodium lauryl sulfate extract activity, It gave a single band on disc electrophoresis, and the molecular weight by gel filtration was 54 000.
This amylase showed maximal activity at 50 degrees C and pH 6.80.
The pH stability range was relatively wide, the enzyme retaining more than 90% of its initial activity in the range of 6.50-9.0.
80% of the activity was retained after 15 min at 50 degrees C. This enzyme produced maltohexaose from starch, amylose and amylopectin by exo-attack, but did not act on alpha- or beta-cyclodextrin, pullulan or maltohexaitol.
Also the enzyme acted on beta-limit dextrins of amylopectin and glycogen to form branched oligosaccharides.
The unusual reaction of this enzyme on beta-limit dextrin is discussed from the standpoint of the stereochemistry of 1,4-alpha- and 1,6-alpha-glucosidic bonds.
This is the anomalous amylase for which it is recognized that 1,6-alpha-glucosidic linkages in the substrates can mimic the effect of 1,4-alpha-bonds, as previously observed in pseudo-priming reactions of E. coli phosphorylase.
N-Bromoacetyl-beta-D-galactosylamine is an irreversible inhibitor of the 'acid' and the 'neutral' beta-galactosidases (beta-D-galactoside galactohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.23) of human liver.
The inhibition of neutral beta-galactosidase only occurs above pH 8.0.
The pH dependence of neutral beta-glucosidase inactivation is essentially identical to that of the neutral beta-galactosidase.
Inhibition of beta-glucosidase by this galactose derivative suggests that the same enzyme may bind glucosides and galactosides.
Furthermore, both neutral beta-galactosidase and beta-glucosidase are inactivated at 52 degrees C with a half-life of 7.5 min.
The presence of a single enzyme with both beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities is also supported by mixed-substrate experiments.
An arabinanase was purified from the culture fluid of Bacillus subtilis F-11.
The process was as follows: salting out by (NH4)2SO4, repeated chromatography on hydroxy apatite and gel filtration on Sepharose-6B.
The purified enzyme was demonstrated to be homogeneous by disc electrophoresis.
The enzyme was found to be active on arabinan and 1,5-arabinan, but inactive on phenyl alpha-L-arabinofuranoside, p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside, arabinoxylan, gum arabic.
The major group of aminopeptidases (EC 3.4.11.-) of intermediate electrophoretic mobility, from Tineola bisselliella larvae, hav been fractionated into six bands by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the properties of these fractions investigated.
They resemble each other in their pH optima of 8.2, their molecular weight of 240 000, their responses to various active site inhibitors and metal cations, and their specificities towards seventeen L-amino-acyl-beta-naphthylamide substrates.
The derivatives of methionine, leucine, alanine, lysine, arginine and glutamic acid were those most rapidly hydrolysed.
They appear to be true aminopeptidases hydrolysing amino acid amides, dipeptides and oligopeptides from the N-terminal end.
An activator of the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-stimulated ATPase present in the human erythrocytes (membrane) has been isolated in soluble form from hemolysates of these cells.
Partial purification has been achieved through use of carboxymethyl-Sephadex chromatography.
The resulting activator fraction contained no hemoglobin and only 0.3% of the total adenylate kinase activity of the cell.
Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it.
Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it.
When (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activity was measured by 32Pi release from (gamma-32P)ATP, freeze-thawed erythrocytes, as well as membranes prepared at pH 5.8 and at pH 7.6, expressed lower values than noted by assay for total Pi release.
When ADP instead of ATP was used as substrate, significant amount of Pi were released by these erythrocyte preparations.
Further study revealed (a) production of ATP and AMP from ADP with membranes and hemolysate alone, and (b) exchange of the gamma-and B-position phosphate on (gama-32P)ATP in the presence of membranes plus hemolysates.
It further supports the conclusion that Pi release from ADP by human erythrocytes (freeze-thawed) and by their isolated membranes is due to formation of ATP by adenylate kinase and hydrolysis of this generated ATP by (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase.
The following points were also established: (a) absence of an ADPase in human erythrocytes; (b) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator enhanced cleavage only of the gama-position of ATP and (c) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator is neither adenylate kinase nor hemoglobin.
Optical and ESR spectra of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase denaturated with acid and alkali are described.
"Residual" activity of alkaline denaturated protein was higher than of acidic denaturated sample.
It is suggested that covalent bonding copper-nitrogen is essential for superoxide dismutase activity of the protein or synthetic copper complexes.
The characteristics of light scattering of cell suspensions in norm (pH 7,2, t=20degreesC) and upon external influences (change of pH and increase of tdegree).
After cell damage n increases.
Alterations of light scattering after cell damage were connected with the increase of deposit of intercellular structure in general scattering.
The protein and proteolipid complexes and oligomycin insensitive soluble ATPase were prepared from rat liver mitochondria.
The incubation of soluble ATPase with protein and proteolipid complexes resulted in restoration of ATPase sensitivity to oligomycin at room temperature.
The process of reconstruction depended on pH, incubation time, temperature and other conditions.
Acetyl-CoA-synthetase was isolated from cells of St. aureus 209-P.
The method of isolation and partial purification of the enzyme is worked out.
Km values of the enzyme for acetate, CoA and ATP are calculated.
p-Chloromercuribenzoate and monoiodoacetate were shown to inhibit the enzyme activity.
The enzyme activity is estimated depending on the age of the cell culture and on the presence of acetate in the culture medium.
Constants of inactivation rate of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) apo-HRP and apo-HRP-protoporphyrin (PP) are estimated at the pH range 2.8-12.8 and 25 degrees C. Two ionogenic groups (acid and alkaline) are detected on cases of HRP and apo-HRP, which are responsible for stable HRP conformation.
HRP stability within the pH range 5-10 exceeded 30 times that of apo-HRP, while the stability apo-HRP-PP complex is similar to that of apo-HRP.
The data obtained show that formation of complex of apo-HRP with PP, an analogue of the prostetic group lacking central Fe atom, practically does not affect the stability of HRP protein globula at pH 5-10, but significantly stabylized apo-HRP at the extreme pH values.
The complex formation of apo-HRP with active prosthetic group - hemin - results on the stable conformation of the HRP protein globula, which suggests a determining role of Fe ion - porphyrin complex (hemin) on the support of the stable HRP structure.
Proteindisulphide reductase is isolated and partially purified from wheat seedlings and some properties of the enzyme are studied: pH optimum is 7.4; temperature optimum - 37 degrees C; Km = 2.6-10(-4)M for the substrate (wheat albumin); Km = 7.5-10(-5) M for coenzyme (NADP-H).
The enzyme is specific for NADP-H and is not active in the presence of NAD-H. Maximal activity of proteindisulphide reductase is developed in anaerobic conditions.
A technique of the estimation of proteindisulphide reductase activity using wheat albumin as a substrate is worked out.
The enzyme activity decreases regularly in the corn ripening and increases under germination.
It is accompanied by the respective increase or decrease in the amount of disulphide bonds in gluten protein and by changes of physico-chemical characteristics of gluten.
Incubation of gluten with the enzyme preparation affects reological properties of gluten (it becomes weaker) and decreases the gluten viscosity of gluten solution.
In comparison with ribonuclease activity the activity of formed complexes changes differently at the stages of transesterification and hydrolysis, and at each stage the effect of polymers on ribonuclease activity essentially differs.
The use of ribonuclease-dextrane sulfate complex in the reaction of uridylyl-(3' leads to 5')-cytidine synthesis demonstrated that the protein synthetic activity completely retained when hydrolytic activity was considerably suppressed.
Quantitative kinetic data are given on the oxidation reaction of dioxyfumaric acid (DFA) with atmospheric oxygen in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) depending on pH.
Activation constants of oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and Mn ions are determined at pH 3.0.
Autocatalytic character of FRA oxidation is shown to be due to the formation of H2O2 and other hydro peroxide-type compounds in the reaction, HRP convertions in the DFA--O2 system are studied using spectrophotometry.
A mechanism of the initiation of free radicals in HRP--DFA--O2 system is proposed.
An improved procedure of purification of serinesulfhydrase from chicken liver is described.
Preparations of enzyme (700-fold purification with the yield of 40 per cent from total activity) have been obtained homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Molecular weight of serinesulfhydrase is 90.000; 1 mole of enzyme contains 2 moles of pyridoxalphosphate and consists apparently of 2 subunits.
Amino acid composition of the enzyme is studied.
Absorption spectrum of serinesulfhydrase has a maximum at 430 nm what is characteristic of numerous pyridoxal-P enzymes.
The position of this maximum does not depend on pH (within its range 6--10) and the presence of  L-serine, a primary enzyme substrate.
An essential change in the absorption spectrum of enzyme was observed in the presence of some thiol compound--DL-homocysteine, beta-mercaptoethanol and glutathione (cosubstrates of the reaction) and L-cysteine (a primary reaction substrate).
It is suggested that this change in the spectrum is due to the action of SH-compounds on the enzyme conformation before the beginning of the enzymatic reaction or on its initial stages.
crysogenum 152A on RNA, synthetic polynucleotides, dinucleosidemonophosphates and nucleoside-2',3'-cyclophosphates is studied.
The enzyme is found to release from RNA guanosine-3'-monophosphate and guanosine-2',3'-cyclophosphate only.
Guanylic acid is a 3'-terminal nucleotide of oligonucleotides of different length.
The enzyme readily hydrolyses poly-I and practically do not splits poly-G. GpN is demonstrated to be a good substrate for the RNase, while G greater than p hydrolyses with a low rate.
The RNAase catalyses the synthesis of GpC (47.7 per cent yield) and GpU (38.8 per cent yield).
chrysogenum 152A is considered to be guanyl-RNAase.
It has been shown that for the reaction catalyzed by "biodegradative" L-threonine dehydratase from E. coli strains K-12 and 980 in 0.5 M phosphate-carbonate buffer, pH 8.4 and pH 9.5, the plots of initial reaction rate (v) versus the initial substrate concentration ([S]0 are characterized by several inflection points, i. e. an intermediate plateau.
The plot of v versus the allosteric activator (AMP) concentration have very complicated shapes: there are several inflection points, and also the maximum at L-threonine concentration equal to 3-10(2) and 5-10(-2) M. High AMP concentrations inhibit the enzyme at high substrate concentrations.
On the basis of the data obtained it is proposed that the substrate and AMP shift the equilibrium between multiple oligomeric enzyme forms differing in catalytic activity and kinetic manifestations of allosteric interactions between the active and allosteric AMP-binding sites towards polymerization.
Thus, the functioning the enzyme under study is discussed in the frames of the model of dissociating regulatory enzymes with multiple intermediate oligomeric forms.
Separation and partial purification of isoenzymes of phosphorylase B from skeletal muscles of lamprey (Lampetra) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) was carried out.
Isoenzyme I was adsorbed on DEAE cellulose and eluted by KCl; isoenzyme II was not adsorbed on DEAE cellulose.
A number of kinetic characteristics of phosphorylase of the coldblooded were determined, e. g. Km values for glucose-1-phosphate, glycogen and AMP; Ki for glucose-6-phosphate; stability towards denaturation (heating and effect of urea) and pH optimum.
It was observed that in the course of evolution of vertebrates the Km values for substrates and allosteric activator (AMP), as well as the inhibition by glucose-6-phosphate showed a decrease.
Isoenzymes I and II of phosphorylase B were found non-identical with respect to some molecular characteristics, in carp the differences being far more pronounced than in lamprey.
n. on pH values is studied.
Native HDS has a short-waved maximum position (325 nm) and a small half-width of the fluorescence spectrum (48nm).
The change in the quantum yield of the enzyme fluorescence was parallel with the change of the enzymatic activity.
Triptophane residues of native HDC are located at hydrophobic region of the enzyme globula.
The dependency of HDC flourescence parameters on pH values in 8 M urea was similar to that of free triptophane.
A comparative study of fluorescences parameters of HDC and its inhibitory complexes with methyl ester of histidine (MEH), hydroxylamine and p-chloromercuriumbensoate is carried out.
The effect of HDC interacting with inhibitors on fluorescence parameters of the enzyme is discussed.
A method of isolating polynucleotidephosphorylase (PNPase) containing polyribosome fraction from rat liver is described.
PNPase is found to be bind to RNA in polyribosomes with weak electrostatic bonds which are easily broken down in a weak alkaline medium with ionic strength more than 0.1 beta-22P-labelled ADP, GDP, UDP and CDP are found among the products of endogenous RNA degradation in the fraction of total polyribosomes in the presence of 32P-orthophosphate.
A considerable change in the base composition of PNP-degraded RNA is observed at different incubation times of total polyribosomes with 32P-orthophosphate: G+C//A+U ratio increased from 2.3 to 3.1, and purines/pyrimidines ratio-from 0.47 to 1.06 with the increase of the incubation time.
Specific activity of PNP in ribosome fractions obtained under ultracentrifugation of total polyribosomes in succrose density gradient (0.3-1.0 M) increased in the direction from the fraction of heavy polysomes to trimers and dimers and then dropped at the region of monomers (80 S particles).
The data obtained give no possibility to determine the type of PNP-bound RNA in polyribomes of rat liver.
The modified procedure for rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase (PFK) purification is worked out utioizing the method of specific elution from DEAE-cellulose in 0.1 M tris-EDTA-phosphate pH 8.0 with 10 mM citrate.
By the latter procedure PFK can be resolved into fractions A, B and C which are eluted specifically, with 0.3 M buffer and with 1.5 M NaCl respectively.
The preparations are characterized by disc electrophoresis and velocity sedimentation.
The results of formalinization experiments demonstrate that high concentrations of formaldehyde dissociate PFK u to the 5.3 S component.
The presence of the 19.3 S component in the formalinized preparations evidences against the possibility that the middle component, presented at the schlieren patterns of PFK at pH 8.0, is and artifact of superposition.
Complex profiles of protein distribution observed in different transport experiments are discussed from the point of view of slow equilibrium of oligomers and conformers characteristic to PFK over the pH range from 6 to 9.
The effect of NADH, succinate and ATP on the sensitivity of a number of energy-dependent functions of submitochondrial particles ot phospholipases A, C and D has been studied.
It has been shown that in the conditions of oxidation of NADH and succinate by oxygen and also of ATP hydrolysis, the decrease in the phosphorylating activity of the particles under the action of phospholipases C and D accelerates.
No such acceleration has been observed with phospholipase A.
For other two functions, i. e. reverse electron transfer (ATP-dependent NAD+ reduction by succinate) and ATP-dependent transhydrogenase reaction the results proved to be different.
Oxidizable substrates and ATP promoted the maintenance of these functions in the presence of phospholipase A, but did not retard their suppression by phospholipases C and D. The effects of NADH, succinate and ATP on the sensitivity  of different energy-dependent functions of submitochondrial particles to phospholipases A, C and D could be removed by the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone.
The conclusion is made that the effects revealed are associated with an increase in the sensitivity of coupling sites II PAND/OR III to phospholipases C and D and with a decrease in the sensitivity of sites I and IV to phospholipase A on energization of submitochondrial particles.
When a mixture of the eighteen proteinous amino acids are suitably heated in the dry state with seawater salts, a copolyamino acid results.
One fraction of this polymer is found, through isoelectric focusing, to consist of a mixture of acidic and basic proteinoids, each of sharply limited heterogeneity.
When one fraction of the seawater proteinoid is dissolved in hot water, and the solution is cooled, proteinoid microspheres result.
These have properties in common with simpler types, but also stable at pH values to 9, in common with microspheres prepared by mixing acidic and basic proteinoids.
In energy transducing systems the direction of energy transfer is proposed to be maintained by the synchronized turnovers of the conformational change of one protein coupling up to affect another.
The exergonic reaction-dependent turnover of the forms of the enzyme within the transition complexes would be maintained, therefore, under asymmetric phase angles of conformational-dependent reactivity that would effectively restrict the microscopic reversibility of transducing systems.
Some well known reactions, such as hemoglobins Bohr effect, can be used to illustrate that microscopic (molecular) interactions subject to thermodynamic equilibria laws may similarly paricipate as driving forces in energy transducing sytems.
This would allow the thermodynamic description of the role of proton translocation as that of a modificatory force of the structural parameters of proteins.
Similarly, the relationship between the liganded states of hemoglobin and its change in conformation has been used to develop an illustrative model relating changes in oxido-reduction of electron carriers to induced-fit effects leading to a sequence of ATPase forms in transition complexes which become stabilized as high energy intermediates under the constraints imposed by the membrane of energy transducing organelles.
Subtilisin BPN' was immobilized to porous glass via isothiocyanate coupling.
The pH optimum of the enzyme was shifted to the alkaline side on binding.
This effect was more pronounced with ethyl lactate than with N-tosyl arginine methyl ester (TAME).
Presumably, the shift is a reflection of the negative charge on the surface of the glass.
The Michaelis constant and Vmax of soluble subtilisin BPN' with TAME were two and one orders of magnitude, respectively, lower than with ethyl lactate.
Vmax, calculated per g of active enzyme, with TAME as the substrate was not affected by immobilization, while Vmax with ethyl lactate decreased greater than tenfold.
The apparent KM decreased on immobilization with ethyl lactate as substrate and increased with TAME.
Results are explained in terms of diffusional resistance and a possible attraction of ethyl lactate to the glass surface.
Active site titration indicated that about 25% of the immobilized enzyme was active.
The profiles thus established may be utilized for investigations of an organism's relationship to its microenvironment including metabolic shifts and pathways.
Practical application of this simplified method would include: a) determination of environmental conditions existing during maximum growth or enzyme synthesis and application of these conditions to feedback control; b) estimation of requirements for pH, oxygen, and heat removal capacities needed for scale-up; c) specific points during the fermentation at which samples should be analyzed to yield maximum information on depletion of nutrients and its effects on microbial activity.
Over several years sera were collected from 14 heterophil-positive students or patients who did not fulfill minimal hematologic criteria for infectious mononucleosis (I.M.)
was investigated by determining antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus-determined antigens, i.e., to viral capsid antigens (VCA), early antigens (EA), and EBV-associated nuclear antigens (EBNA).
On the basis of detectable anti-EA and/or the early absence and late emergence of anti-EBNA, four of these 14 individuals showed evidence of a current or very recent primary Epstein-Barr virus infection.
The other ten patients showed antibody patterns indicative of Epstein-Barr virus infections in the past, and no firm conclusions could be drawn with regard to the specificity of their heterophil reactions.
It was assumed, however, that some represented atypical clinical forms of EBV infection and that timing of specimen collection was a factor in explaining the paucity of Downey cells.
In three patients, the absorbed heterophil-positive reactions persisted with little change in titer for at least 22 mo and thus might represent false-positive tests.
Bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) from an unrelated, HL-A-phenotype-identical, MLC-negative donor was performed in a 31 year old woman with severe longlasting aplastic anemia.
In vitro assays failed to demonstrate humoral or cellular sensitization of the recipient against donor-type antigens.
Following conditioning with cyclophosphamide, prompt but only transient engraftment of the transplant occurred accompanied by signs of mild graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) of the liver.
The results of a second bone marrow transplantation from the same donor cannot be evaluated due to early death of the recipient.
It is concluded that bone marrow from unrelated, HL-A and MLC-identical donors may engraft without severe GVHD.
Rejection of the graft in our patient may have been related to greater antigenic differences that can be expected to exist between HL-A and MLC-identical unrelated individuals than between HL-A and MLC-identical siblings.
However, insufficient preparative immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide due to severe hepatic hemosiderosis appears equally likely as the cause of graft rejection.
The possibly increased risk of graft rejection or severe GVHD should not preclude the use of unrelated HL-A and MLC-identical marrow donors, when histocompatible sibling donors are not available; but more potent immunosuppressive regimens than the cyclophosphamide protocol may be necessary to ensure permanent engraftment.
1 The concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline in various organs, arterial plasma and venous outflow from isolated hearts of adult chickens have been determined.
2 The relative adrenaline concentrations (percentage of the sum of noradrenaline and adrenaline) in the heart (33%), spleen (16%) and brain (26%) were higher than those found in mammalian organs.
Chemical sympathectomy by pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine caused a decrease of the noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations in the heart to 20 and 23% and in the spleen to 16 and 29%, respectively.
3 Stimulation of the right sympathetic nerves, infusion of tyramine or infusion of a modified Tyrode solution containing 108mM K+ and 44 mM Na+ caused an output of both noradrenaline and adrenaline into the perfusate of isolated hearts.
The relative adrenaline concentration in the perfusate (20-28%) was not significantly different from the relative adrenaline concentration remaining in these hearts (19-22%).
In the individual experiments, the noradrenaline: adrenaline ratios of the stimulation perfusates were positively correlated with the ratios found in the hearts.
4 The effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline on cardiac rate and tension development were studied in spontaneously beating right atria and electrically driven left atria, respectively.
In addition, the arterial pressure rise in response to noradrenaline or adrenaline was;measured in chickens.
It was found that the cardio-vaseart rate, cardiac tension development and arterial blood pressure, was not significantly different from that of adrenaline.
5 It is concluded that, in the chicken heart and spleen, both noradrenaline and adrenaline act as sympathetic neutrotransmitters.
1  The antiarrhythmic, haemodynamic and metabolic effects of a new amino steroid, ORG6001, have been investigated in experimental acute myocardial infarction in anaesthetized greyhounds.
2 ORG6001 administered either intravenously (2-10 mg/kg) or orally (50 mg/kg) significantly reduced the incidence of ventricular ectopic beats in the first 30 min after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
3 In dogs pretreated with ORG6001, metabolic changes indicative of myocardial ischaemia (lactate production and potassium efflux) were less marked than those occurring in control animals.
5 These results suggest that ORG6001 may possess distinct advantages over presently-used antiarrhythmic drugs in the prevention and treatment of the early arrhythmias which occur after myocardial infarction.
1 The use of radioactive microspheres is described for the measurement of cardiac output in anaesthetized rabbits and its redistribution after the administration of drugs which lower blood pressure.
3 SK&F 24260, (1,4 dihydro-2, 6-dimethyl-4(2-trifluoremethylpheny)-3,5,-pyridinedicarboxylic acid diethyl ester), had similar vasocilator actions.
4 Guanethidine had a relatively small effect on total peripheral conductance and lowered blood pressure mainly by reducing stroke volume and cardiac output.
The effect of attitudes of therapists, patients and researchers on the conduct and outcome of combined drug and psychotherapy research was examined in a brief crisis-oriented psychotherapy clinic.
Seventy-seven consecutive patients were given one of two anti-anxiety drugs or a placebo in conjunction with the typical psychoanalytically-oriented treatment used in the clinic.
The therapists' attitudes favouring psychotherapy over drug therapy (and psychotherapy research) were clearly conveyed to the patients.
Indicative of this are the following: (a) 82 per cent of the patients dropped out of drug taking, although a similar percentage remained in treatment; (b) only a third of the patients perceived it as being important to their therapists that they should take medication; (c) 87 per cent of the patients were rated as improved; and 75 per cent of patients completing forms considered that most or all of their improvement was attributable to talking.
The research team, made up of members of the same department who therefore had similar values as the therapists, diligently collected outcome data, but ignored its responsibility to enforce drug-relation portions of the protocol.
Overall, patients remained in therapy, improved and participated in completing forms, so that only the research goals of combined therapy were thwarted, while traditional clinic service and training goals proceeded as usual.
A transplantable mouse testicular teratoma (OTT 6050) which displays a spectrum of neuroepithelial differentiation was evaluated biochemically for concentrations of cyclic AMP (cAMP), serotonin (5-HT), and enzymes involved in the metabolism of the biogenic amines and acetylcholine.
These values were compared between teratomas with neuroepithelial differentiation as the major or minor component and brains of neonatal and adult mice of related strains.
cAMP, 5-HT, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) were present.
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and of the cholinergic system, i.e.
choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase, were studied.
Biochemical differences in tumor groups probably reflected variations in the proportion of neuroepithelial components: trends suggested an increase of cAMP and an increased activity of TPH, AADC, TH and DBH in tumors with increased proportions of neuroepithelial cells.
These findings indicate that the neuroepithelial component of the mouse teratoma may serve as a model for the study of neuronal differentiation in primitive neuroepithelial neoplasms.
To examine the regulation of development of end organ innervation the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), and two of its target organs, the iris and pineal gland, were studied using biochemical and histofluorescent approaches.
During postnatal ontogeny the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (T-OH), which is localized to adrenergic neurons, increased 50-fold in iris, and 34-fold in pineal nerve terminals of the rat.
These increases paralleled the in vitro rise in iris [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) uptake, a measure of the presence of functional nerve terminal membrane.
These biochemical indices of end organ innervation correlated well with developmental increases in density of innervation, adrenergic ground plexus ramification and nerve fiber fluorescence intensity as determined by fluorescence microscopy.
Unilateral transection of the presynaptic cholinergic nerves innervating the SCG in 2-3-day-old rats prevented the normal development of end organ innervation: T-OH activity, [3H]NE uptake, innervation density, plexus ramification and fluorescence intensity failed to develop normally in irides innervated by decentralized ganglia.
It is concluded that trans-synaptic factors regulate the maturation of adrenergic nerve terminals, and the development of end organ innervation by SCG.
Rat placental alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1), a dimer of 135,000 daltons, is strongly activated by Mg2+.
However, Zn2+ has to be present on the apoenzyme to obtain this activation.
Mg2+ alone is unable to reconstitute functional active sites.
Excess Zn2+ which competes for the Mg2+ site leads to a phosphatase with little catalytic activity at alkaline pH but with normal active sites at acidic pH as shown by covalent incorporation of ortho-[32P]phosphate.
Two enzyme species with identical functional active sites have been reconstituted that only differ by the presence of Zn2+ or Mg2+ at the effector site.
A mechanism is presented by which alkaline phosphatase activity of rat placenta would be controlled by a molecular process involving the interaction of Mg2+ and Zn2+ with the dimeric enzyme molecule.
A kinetic study of procine chymotrypsin A-pi revealed two characteristic properties of this type of chymotrypsin: 1.
Porcine chymotrypsin A-pi, like bovine chymotrypsin B-pi does not bind proflavin, which is a competitive inhibitor of bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin A-alpha.
The pH profiles of the steady-state parameters show the two usual important pK's.
The basic one, pK2 = 9.6, affects both Km and kcat/Km and probably controls the binding conformation of chymotrypsin.
The value of pK1 is unusually low.
The free and bound forms of alpha,alpha-trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28) of the honey bee thorax were separated and the bound enzyme was solubilized by raising the pH to 8.0 for 10 h. Both enzymes were purified.
They were homogeneous as determined by several electrophoretic criteria.
It was found that the two enzymes had very similar Km's (each about 0.89 mM), Vm's (53.2 and 54.3 U/mg for free and solubilized, respectively), inhibition characteristics, specificities (both only hydrolyzed alpha,alpha-trehalose), pH maxima (each had maxima at about 3.5 and 6.5), molecular weights (65,000), isoelectric points (5.1), reactivities to sulfhydryl reagents, electrophoretic mobilities, activation energies (about 12.8 kcal/mol), and similar stabilities to heat, pH, and urea.
Some significant differences between the two enzymes were, however, found: the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase floated at 70% saturation of ammonium sulfate while the free alpha,alpha-trehalase did not; the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase did not dissociate into subunits as readily as did the free one; and the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase was found to bind more readily to a hydrophobic grouping than the free enzyme.
In addition to these comparisons, three new findings relating to thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases are reported.
(1) Thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases are strongly inhibited by beta-glucosides (Ki values of about 8 x 10(-4) M); (2) under certain conditions thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases from honey bees dissociated into subunits of one-half the normal molecular weight; (3) honey bee thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases have unusual biphasic pH activity profiles.
Immunotherapy of cancer is of interest to oncologists because it is specifically directed to cancer cells, sparing normal cells.
While it is ineffective in most patients, especially those with widespread metastatic disease, it occasionally produces good results.
Each of the available methods has inherent problems and, recently, attempts have been made to overcome some of these.
There is a strong case for small-scale experimental trials in highly selected groups of patients who are intensively investigated for their immunologic status in relation to their tumour.
Despite the lack of success in general, immunotherapy still appears to have a future as an adjunct to existing therapy in order to control as much as to cure residual tumour.
L-[alphaS,5S]-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (NSC-163501), an antibiotic elaborated by Streptomyces sviceus, has been shown to be a powerful inhibitor of many mammalian and bacterial reactions involving the transfer of nitrogen from the gamma-carboxamide of L-glutamine.
Thus, the utilization of L-glutamine for the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate, L-asparagine, guanosine-5'-monophosphate, cytidine-5'-triphosphate, N-formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide, NAD, glucosamine-6-phosphate, and anthranilic acid is strongly or totally inhibited by a concentration of NSC-163501 of 1 X 10(-3) M. L-Glutamate synthetase of Escherichia coli is only modestly inhibited and 5-phosphoribosylamine synthesis in fetal rat liver is comparatively refractory to inhibition.
NSC-163501 treatment of L1210 cells growing in a low L-glutamine culture medium produced arrest in G or early S phase.
Of the amino acids tested, only L-glutamine antagonized such growth inhibition.
The antitumor and immunosuppressive activities of the lankacidin-group antibiotics were studied in mice.
Seventeen of 29 newly prepared lankacidin-group antibiotics, including 14-derivatives of lankacidin C, lankacidinol, isolankacidinol, and lankacidinol 14-acetate, possessed considerable antitumor activity against ascites 6C3HED/OG lymphosarcoma.
Comparative studies on the antitumor activity of lankacidin C and eight of its derivatives against L1210 leukemia and solid 6C3HED/OG lymphosarcoma demonstrated that replacement of the hydroxyl group at position 8 or 14 of lankacidin C by an acyloxy group potentiated antitumor activity.
However, these modifications of lankacidin C resulted in reduction of the immunosuppressive activity.
Previous studies on renin release by an in vitro system of rat kidney slices, which is devoid of hemodynamic influences, have provided evidence that renin release is stimulated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.
We used this system to study effects of tyramine (an indirectly acting amine capable of displacing endogenous catecholmines from sympathetic nerve endings) on renin release.
Tyramine (10(-3)M) in the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (pheniprazine, 10(-5)M) and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (theophylline, 10(-3)M) significantly (P less than 0.01) stimulated renin release when values were compared to control observations for media containing only the inhibitors.
Tyramine-induced stimulation of renin release was blocked by the beta-blocking agent, propranolol (2 X 10(-4) M), and the neural uptake blocking agent, cocaine (10(-5) M), but not by the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine (9 X 10(-4) M).
These observations demonstrate a potential role for the sympathetic innervation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus on renin release.
Sera from patients with hepatobiliary disorders were selected to represent a wide range of activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase (EC 2.3.2.2).
Samples were stored at 4 degrees C and periodically tested for as long as nine weeks, others at -6 degrees C for as long as 40 weeks.
The activity of the enzyme was essentially unchanged under both conditions of storage.
Continuous monitoring of heat denaturation of a mixture of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes at 60 degrees C and pH 7.5 permits the simultaneous direct identification and quantitation of three isoenzymes: the placental isoenzyme, the L-phenylalanine-sensitive intestinal isoenzyme, and the liver isoenzyme (hepatocytic).
The isoenzyme that is principally of bone origin cannot be identified as such without the help of other diagnostic aids and the patient's medical history.
All human tissues contain alkaline phosphatase, many organs more than one of the isoenzymes.
Liver alkaline phosphatase, which constitutes 40-50% of normal serum alkaline phosphatase activity, was measured in the serum of persons with various liver diseases.
Its activity exceeded normal in all types of liver disease; in 80% of cases this increase was accompanied by increased gamma-glutamyl-transferase activity, but the quantitative correlationship (r = 0.54) was not as good as expected if both enzymes come from the same source and are indices of liver dieases.
Liver alkaline phosphatase activity increases in the blood early in liver disease, before most liver tests show abnormalities.
The other major isoenzyme of normal serum probably represents a mixture of isoenzymes from bone and reticulo-endothelial and vascular tissues, which all contain the same "very heat-labile" alkaline phosphatase.
Cord blood and children's sera contain mostly this very heat-labile isoenzyme.
An optimized end-point method that requires little sophisticated equipment is described for estimating serum cystyl-aminopeptidase during pregnancy.
S-Benzyl-L-cysteine-4-nitroanilide is used as the substrate.
I describe a simple, single-tube batch fractionation procedure for separating MM and MB isoenzymes of creatine kinase on a macroporous strong anion exchanger (AG MP-1, Bio-Rad Laboratories).
The isoenzymes can be separated in less than 3 min, with a resulting dilution of the serum with no more than an equal volume of buffer.
Sensitivity is limited by the sensitivity and precision of the method of measurement.
The CV for the fractionation can be held to less than 4.0% at 65 U of MB per liter.
With use of a discrete analyzer (Du Pont aca) the mean MB activity in a population free of heart disease was 3.2 +/- 3.0 U/liter (range, 0 to 8 U/liter).
It is demonstrated that urinary tryptamine decreases significantly with increasing urinary pH.
This effect becomes important at a urinary pH of 6.5 and over.
Urinary gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) has been found to be stable when stored at room temperature and 4 degrees C. Activity is lost rapidly when urine is frozen but prior dialysis will prevent this loss.
Urea is the major factor responsible for the loss of activity; albumin is protective at concentrations of 6 g/l or more.
A factor of 10 000-30 000 molecular weight which will prevent the loss of urinary gamma-GT activity on freezing has been found in serum and urine; it has high potency in serum and in urine from patients with chronic renal failure, but only low potency in normal urine.
Its nature is unknown but it is heat stable.
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the properties of beta-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) in human synovial fluid.
It was shown to have a pH requirement of 5.0 and a KM value of about 8.0 - 10(-3) M using phenolphthalein beta-glucuronide as the substrate.
At low substrate concentration an endogenous inhibitor is demonstrable.
The inhibition is of the competitive type and is removed by proteolytic digestion of synovial fluid, whereas hyaluronidase digestion and addition either of Triton X-100 or of various salts to the assay mixture, are ineffective.
The possibility that the inhibitor is a protein from serum is discussed.
A 12-year-old girl of Spanish origin was found to be double heterozygote for a deficient GP I variant (GP I Barcelona) and for a silent GP I gene.
The mother was heterozygote for GP I Barcelona and the father was heterozygote for the silent gene.
GP I Barcelona was a fast variant (116%) with an increased isoelectric point (9.55), lability to heat and to urea, and shift of the pH curve towards the acidic pH.
The ratio of enzymatic activity to immunological reactivity was normal in erythrocytes and white blood cells of the father and the mother but decreased to 75% of normal in blood cells of the daughter.
A method is described for detecting the simultaneous presence of Fc and C3 receptors on mouse spleen cells.
Both T-cell and non-T-cell Fc receptors were blocked by aggregated mouse IgG2 to the same degree.
C3, but not Fc, receptors were blocked by factors present in the serum of irradiated mice or mice undergoing graft-versus-host reaction.
Thymocytes activated by injection into irradiated F1 hybrid mice, and thymocytes regenerating after irradiation and bone marrow injection, appeared to have increased Fc receptors.
A general role for Fc and C3 receptors in T cell-B cell co-operation is suggested.
Because of reports of fluroxene toxicity in man, the effect of phenobarbital treatment on the toxicity and metabolism of fluroxene was studied in 9 rhesus monkeys.
Four monkeys that had previously survived received exposures to fluroxene and 3 monkeys that had no exposure to fluroxene died during fluroxene anesthesia after treatment with phenobarbital (mean time, 3 hr).
Toxicity was manifested by arterial hypotension, pulmonary edema, and arterial hypoxemia.
Phenobarbital treatment enhanced production of fluroxene metabolites, including the highly toxic trifluoroethanol.
Concentrations of trifluoroethanol in mixed-expired gas, blood, and urine, and of total nonvolatile fluorine in blood, urine, and tissues of animals treated with phenobarbital were 2 to 10 times as in control animals.
The results suggest that the rhesus monkey is a valuable model for the study of fluroxene pharmacology and that inclusion of an enzyme-inducing challenge in the evaluation of potential toxicity of other anesthetics seems warranted.
The effectiveness of intravenously administered propranolol in antagonizing the chronotropic effect of isoproterenol and exercise has been investigated, and has been found at all times to be a predictable function of its plasma concentrations according to the classical drug-receptor theory for competitive antagonism.
The data show further that the relationship between effectiveness and time depends on the way in which antagonism is measured.
If the dose ratio to isoproterenol (DR) is measured, then (DR-1) declines with time in parallel with drug concentration.
On the other hand, if propranolol's effects are measured as percentage reduction in a given response, then this declines linearly with time, even though plasma concentrations decline exponentially.
This fact explains why confusion has in the past arisen concerning the relationship of the duration of beta blockade and pharmacokinetic half-life.
Lorazepam, a new benzodiazepine, was compared with a standard surgical premedicant, pentobarbital.
In a double-blind study in 128 patients, lorazepam, 2 and 4 mg, and pentobarbital, 50 and 100 mg, were given intravenously in a randomized sequence.
Significant differences were noted; lorazepam was found to provide greater sedation, lack of recall, and greater antianxiety effect than pentobarbital.
No significant adverse effects were noted following either drug.
The question of pH or flow dependence for the renal elimination of procainamide (PCA) was studied under 4 conditions in each of 4 subjects.
Each subject received 500 mg of PCA intravenously at weekly intervals while in a state of (1) acid load (NH4Cl) and water deprivation, (2) acid load and water excess, (3) alkali load (NaHCO3) and water deprivation, and (4) alkali load and water excess.
Plasma and urine were collected at frequent intervals for PCA and N-acetyl PCA (NAPA) analysis.
Urine flow rates varied markedly between the water deprivation and water excess states (approximately 1.2 vs 5 ml/min, respectively), and urine pH varied markedly between the acid and alkali load states (pH = ca 5 vs 8, respectively).
Despite this marked variation, there were no significant changes in PCA renal clearance or 24-hr PCA or NAPA excretion.
If passive diffusion of PCA were taking place, such flow and pH changes would have caused marked changes in PCA clearance were the pH partition hypothesis true.
We therefore conclude that passive diffusion is not an important mechanism in the renal elimination of PCA in man and that there must be tubular secretion.
The implication for the clinical use of the drug is that dose adjustments need not be made in response to variations in urine flow and pH.
A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out on data derived from single 24 h urine collections from 246 male idiopathic calcium stone-formers.
The daily urine volume and pH and the exretions of calcium, oxalate, phosphate, creatinine and magnesium were related to the time of year when the urine was collected, and the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and octocalcium phosphate calculated for each month.
There were significant seasonal variations in the urinary excretion of calcium and oxalate, each showing a maximum during the summer months and a minimum in the winter.
There was no significant seasonal variation in urinary pH, volume, creatinine, phosphate or magnesium.
There was a significant increase in the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and a trend towards higher saturation levels of octo-calcium phosphate in the summer.
These changes were dependent only on the seasonal variation in urinary calcium and oxalate and not on urine volume.
A retrospective study of the seasonal incidence of stone episodes among these 246 stone-formers showed that the rate of stone passage per month was 50% higher in the summer than in the winter.
There was no significant seasonal variation in the incidence of stones removed surgically.
138 patients with panarteritis of the aorta and its branches were examined, and the clinical and morphological findings were compared.
The disease is more widespread than has been assumed so far, and is more frequent in young women.
Localization of the process in the abdominal aorta with involvement (stenosis) of renal arteries causes renovascular hypertension, which often has a malignant course, especially with an ambilateral affection of renal arteries.
In the treatment, repetitive therapeutic courses with corticosteroids and heparin are of fundamental importance.
With an isolated affection, especially in renovascular hypertension and disturbances of cerebral circulation, surgical treatment is also indicated.
Fifty-eight neurotic patients with intense anxiety were treated with either lorazepam or diazepam in a double blind between-patients trial.
Statistical analysis indicated that the two groups were homogeneous before treatment and that the results of treatment were similar for both drugs.
According to the global rating of illness week after week, after four weeks of treatment more patients on lorazepam than on diazepam were normal or had mild illness (82.1% vs. 70.8%).
In the investigators' judgment, 71.9% of the patients treated with lorazepam had an excellent or good response compared with 56.7+ of those treated with diazepam.
The mean reduction in score on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale was 17.7 for lorazepam and 16.5 for diazepam.
The largest dose of lorazepam required in treatment was 6 mg, compared with 30 mg of diazepam.
Two patients treated with lorazepam had side effects, against six with diazepam.
Six patients in the diazepam group did not complete the trial, including three who discontinued because of side effects (rash, tremors, agitation); no patients in the lorazepam group dropped out.
The presence of p-chlorophenoxyacetamide was detected in the urine of man receiving iproclozide [1-(p-chlorophenoxyacetyl)-2-isopropylhydrazine].
This new metabolite was identified by combined gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and by comparison with the synthetic compound.
An appropriate procedure for the extraction and quantitation of p-chlorophenoxyacetamide by gas-liquid chromatography on a 5% OV-225-packed column with the 2-butyl analog of iproclozide as an internal standard, has been developed.
After 20- and 50-mg single dose oral administrations of iproclozide, 5.2 and 8.3% were slowly excreted in urine as p-chlorophenoxyacetamide within 30.5 and 36 hr.
After 20-mg oral intakes by psychiatric patients, the 24-hr urinary excretion of p-chlorophenoxyacetamide amounted to about 2-4% of the iproclozide dose administered.
Repeated oral treatment of male rats with piperazine-substituted phenothiazine drugs in doses of 25 mg/kg or more daily led to an accumulation of metabolites containing an ethylenediamine group instead of the piperazine ring.
These products of ring degradation with and without removal of the N-alkyl group were found, together with the parent drugs and their N-dealkylated metabolites, in liver, lung, kidney, and spleen, as well as in brain when high doses were administered.
Parallel observations were made in dogs given fluphenazine in daily doses of up to 40 mg/kg.
Quantitative differences were observed in the relative amounts of mono- and disubstituted ethylenediamine metabolites accumulated in rat tissues during treatment with the various drugs; the proportion of the monosubstituted product formed by N-dealkylation and ring cleavage declined in the following order: perazine, prochlorperazine, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine.
Condensation products of the ethylenediamine derivatives with formaldehyde were split in the extraction procedure used.
The biotransformation of 14C-triflubazam (ORF 8063; 1-methyl-5-phenyl-7-trifluoromethyl-1H-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-4-[3H,5H]-dione) was investigated in rats, dogs, and monkeys.
Urinary metabolites, representing 65, 74, and 87%, respectively, of the total urinary radioactivity excreted by these three species, were isolated by preparative layer chromatography and characterized by various spectral techniques including gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, solid probe mass spectrometry, polarimetry, and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.
No parent drug was found in the urine of any species.
N-demethylated metabolites were not isolated from rat urine.
Five metabolites were isolated from dog urine, including 4-hydroxyphenyl, dihydrodiol, and catechol derivatives of triflubazam.
Unlike the case of the rat, a catechol-O-methyl ether was not detected in dog urine.
Six metabolites were isolated from monkey urine.
The only major difference in metabolism in the monkey was the existence of both the dihydrodiol and N-desmethyldihydrodiol metabolites.
No catechol-0-methyl ether was detected in monkey urine.
Biotransformation through a common arene oxide intermediate can be proposed for these three animal species.
5-(2'4'-Difluorophenyl) [carboxy-14C]salicyclic acid (MK-647) was quickly and completely absorbed in rats, dogs, and man.
Peak levels of plasma radioactivity occurred in 1-2 hr after oral administration.
The dose was 10 mg/kg in rats and dogs, and 50 or 500 mg in man.
Most of the drug in plasma was intact MK-647 which was extensively bound to plasma protein.
In man the peak concentration following the 500-mg dose was approximately 10 times that after the lower dose, which suggests that absorption rates of both doses were similar.
Elimination of drug from plasma was dose-dependent.
The area under the curve for MK-647-14C in plasma was 18 times higher following the 500-mg dose than the 50-mg dose.
Dogs given 10 mg/kg orally or intravenously excreted 44% of the dose in the urine and 42% in the feces in 72 hr.
Rats given the same dose level by either route of administration excreted 80% in the urine and 11% in the feces.
In man approximately 95% of a 50- or 500-mg oral dose was excreted in the urine and 3% in the feces, in 96 hr.
MK-647 and two metabolites were present in the urine of three species.
The ether and ester glucuronides were identified in human urine.
The latter metabolite was also identified in rat and dog urine.
The glycine conjugate of MK-647 was not observed in the urine of the three species.
No interaction was observed between MK-647 and bishydroxycoumarin in the prothrombin time test nor with tolbutamide in the glucose tolerance test.
A significant lowering of hexobarbital sleeping time was observed in female, but not male rats after four consecutive daily doses of MK-647.
After repeated daily administration of MK-647 (12.5-100 mg/kg), the diurnal plasma level in dogs was not significantly altered, indicating that no saturation, induction, or inhibition of its own metabolism took place.
A single exposure to a severe stressor (either cold swim or inescapable shock) impairs subsequent performance in a shuttle avoidance-escape task (1), a deficit attributed to reduction in brain noradrenergic activity produced by these stressors.
In the present paper, two experiments are described which examine how repeated exposure to such stressors affects (a) shuttle avoidance-escape performance (Experiment 1), and (b) aspects of brain norepinephrine metabolism (Experiment 2).
Experiment 1 showed that, whereas subjects receiving the single exposure to cold swim or shock showed a large avoidance-escape deficit, subjects that received repeated exposure to these stressors for 14 days performed similarly to the control group that received no stressor.
Experiment 2 showed that, whereas subjects that received one session of the inescapable shock stressor showed a lower level of norepinephrine in hypothalamus and cortex than did subjects that received no shock, subjects that received repeated exposure to inescapable shock or cold swim showed neurochemical "habituation."
Subjects that received repeated shock showed elevated tyrosine hydroxylase activity and no depletion of norepinephrine level, and both repeated shock and cold swim caused a decrease in uptake of 3H-norepinephrine by slices of cortex in vitro.
Thus, it is concluded that the behavioral and neurochemical changes that were observed after the stressful conditions studied are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in avoidance-escape responding following exposure to these stressful events are due to changes in brain noradrenergic activity.
78 patients suffering from various functional abdominal complaints have been trated in a 2 x 2 double-blind design: (a) psychotherapy with Ro 5-3350 (TH/Ro); (b) psychotherapy with placebo (TH/P); (c) Ro 5-3350 without psychotherapy (NIH/Ro); (d) placebo without psychotherapy (NTH/P).
Some of the results concerning the combination of TH and the psychotropic drug pose interesting questions for further research and bare implications for double-blind trials of psychotropic drugs.
The results suggest that possibly properties of any psychotropic drug have to be related to a doctor-patient relationship within which the personal problems of the patient are dealt with.
Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and blood values of PO2, PCO2, and pH were studied in unanesthetized rats for 8 hours.
After a cardiotoxic dose of 20 mg/kg isoprenaline, s.c., blood pressure fell from 117 to 72 mm Hg, heart rate accelerated from 326 to 497 beats/minute, and cardiac work diminished by about 15%.
Metabolic rate increased by about 80%, blood values of PO2 rose, and those of PCO2 fell somewhat, whereas blood pH dropped from 7.48 to 7.38, indicating metabolic acidosis.
Propranolol (40 mg/kg, i.p.)
and verapamil (50 mg/kg, i.p.
), both of which almost completely prevented isoprenaline-induced cardiac necroses, inhibited the chronotropic and calorigenic actions of isoprenaline by about 50%.
While propranolol inhibited the depressor effect of isoprenaline completely, verapamil enhanced it: blood pressure fell to 46 mm Hg.
Isoprenaline-induced fall of blood pH was not prevented by either propranolol or verapamil.
Decrease of blood pH and cardionecrotisation were enhanced when isoprenaline was given together with 4.8 g/kg ethanol, p.o.
In conclusion, hemodynamic actions of isoprenaline, especially hypotension, seem to be nonessential for the production of cardiac necroses.
Strong acidification can aggravate the cardiotoxicity of isoprenaline.
In the albino rat, the evolvement of myocardial necrosis induced by a single injection of ISO was accompanied by a fall in total NE.
Pretreatment with propranolol and pargyline protected against ISO-induced necrosis and myocardial hypertrophy, but did not influence the ISO-induced depletion of NE stores.
The depletion of NE stores is not due to impairment in synthesis or increased intraneuronal metabolism of NE since, in ISO-treated rats, neither cardiac tyrosine hydroxylase activity nor MAO activity was altered.
The decrease in endogenous NE is not due to a defect in the storage of NE.
The ability of myocardium to take up and store NE returned to normal within 48 hours, whereas endogenous levels returned to normal within 5 days, even in the presence of demonstrable necrosis.
Thus, there is lack of correlation between chemical and morphological changes, since catecholamine depletion occurred in the absence of morphologically demonstrable tissue injury, and the function of the adrenergic neuron returns to normal in the presence of demonstrable necrosis.
The crucial point in the pathogenesis of isoproterenol-induced myocardial necrotization is an abundant intracellular Ca accumulation leading to high energy phosphate exhaustion.
Accordingly, in the early stage of the isoproterenol-induced necrotization process, the onset of ATP and creatine phosphate breakdown strictly parallels the acute Ca gain.
In this type of necrosis, the Mg losses from the myocardium appear as a concomitant phenomenon.
The hearts can be protected against the deleterious Ca overload and necrotization by increasing the plasma concentration of Mg, K, or H ions in order to counterbalance Ca according to the ration (see article).
On the other hand, if Mg, K, or H ion concentrations are too low, isoproterenol-induced Ca uptake and myocardial lesions are potentiated.
Addition of the cell soluble supernatant fraction to an assay medium containing NADPH generating system, mixed function oxidase substrate and microsomes, resulted in a stimulation of drug metabolism ranging from 12-75%.
This stimulation was observed only when the supply of DADPH generating system (isocitric dehydrogenase or glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase) was insufficient, leading to a NADPH oxidation rate which was greater than the rate of reduction of NADP+ during the oxidation of a drug.
Hence, under our assay conditions, the soluble supernate (SS) is only providing sufficient NADPH generator, and possibly relieving inhibition by the generated NADP+.
Finally, microsomal lipid peroxidation measurements under these same conditions indicate negligible to no peroxidation activity in the absence of SS.
The analgesic activity of delta9THC, morphine and sodium salicylate was studied concomitantly with changes in brain stem levels of 5HT, 5HIAA, DA and NA.
The results show that a correlation exists between analgesia and changes in the serotonergic system of the brain stem.
Furthermore morphine sulfate was found to increase the DA concentration of the brain stem while delta9THC increased NA levels.
We conclude that serotonergic system may be of major importance in analgesia while simultaneous changes in this system and/or the DA and NA systems may lead to a more pronounced analgesic activity.
A simple and convenient colorimetric method is described for the quantitative determination of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and N-acetyl-5-ASA in urine and feces after oral administration of salicylazosulfa-pyridine (SASP), the drug of choice in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
N-acetyl-5-ASA is extracted directly from the acidified biological specimen, deacetylated, and the liberated 5-ASA subjected to a modified Bratton-Marshall reaction.
The 5-ASA present in the specimen must be acetylated with acetic anhydride prior to extraction.
The violet colored product of the Bratton-Marshall reaction has a lambdamax of 560 nm and conforms to Beer's law over the concentration range of 0-70 umg/ml.
Average recoveries (+/- S.D., N = 6) OF 5-ASA added to rat and human urine and rat fecal homogenates were 91.6 +/- 4.9%, 102 +/- 6.0%, and 71.0 +/- 4.8%, respectively.
Interference by SASP and its sulfapyridine metabolities is negligible.
As demonstrated, the colorimetric method is of sufficient sensitivity for application in most metabolic and pharmacokinetic studies conducted with SASP in laboratory animals and man.
In 24 patients (16 women, 8 men, mean age 60 years), who underwent abdominal operations and who had a uncomplicated postoperative course, a teflon-tube was inserted into the portal vein at the end of laparotomy and remained there for maximal 9 days.
The mean values of the portal venous pressure as well as of the portal-central venous pressure gradient are unchanged during the period of all 9 days and are between 7,4 and 7,9 mmHg, between 5,6 and 6,9 mmHg respectively.
The arterio-portal venous 0(2)-content difference shows in the mean no fluctuations and is about 2 Vol.%.
On the first postoperative day the lactic and pyruvic acid concentrations in the artery and portal vein are moderately, but significantly elevated and decrease to normal values until day 7.
Animal experiments were set up mainly to derive additional diagnostic data from the study of biochemical changes after acute head injury.
In standardized experiments guinea pigs were subjected in groups of 20 to three identical head injuries, each of either 1.0 J or 1.5 J intensity.
The trauma was likely to result in a concussion or contusion syndrome similar to that found in man; 40 animals served as controls.
During the 60 min after injury observation and measurement of body functions did not reveal signs of a shock-like condition or hypoxaemia in the traumatized animals compared with control animals.
Superficial anaesthesia probably did not influence the findings.
Temperature and respiration were altered significantly in all the animals receiving head injuries.
Blood gas analysis showed a decrease of standard bicarbonate only after the 1.5 J injury but even though hypoxaemia was not present 2,3-diphosphoglycerate values and P50 increased, compared with the control animals.
The fall of plasma lipid concentrations reported probably had to be seen as a sympathomimetic effect of the minor (1.0 J) trauma.
Of special significance was the increased activity of malate dehydrogenase and aldolase, found only in the blood of severely traumatized animals, as this could serve as an early diagnostic aid for evaluating head injuries.
Cross-clamping of the ascending aorta in dogs for 15 min produced severe neurological deficit, observed for up to 20 h. Immediately after restoration of the circulation, the intracranial pressure in the cisterna magna increased transiently to a mean peak of 22.8 Torr (SD +/- 1.7) because of a compensatory increase in systemic arterial pressure, without a fall in cerebral perfusion pressure.
The intracranial pressure returned to control values 15-30 min after ischaemia and showed no secondary rise during the 8 h of observation.
The electroencephalogram became isoelectric 34 +/- 6.5 s (mean +/-SD) after circulatory occlusion, and was abnormal when it reappeared 5 h 36 min (SD +/- 2 h 4 min) after the circulation was restored.
The electrical impedance of the brain increased immediately after ischaemia and returned rapidly towards pre-ischaemic values during re-perfusion.
The cerebral water had not increased measurably 4 h after ischaemia.
After ischaemia, the lactate concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid increased to 4.7 mequiv./1(SEM +/-0.1) and the pH decreased to 7.17 (SEM +/-0.02); both returned to control values after 3.5 h. The cerebral glucose uptake was decreased 35 min after ischaemia, cerebral oxygen uptake remained unchanged but cerebral blood flow decreased (P less than 0.05 at 90 min).
Immediately after cardiac arrest, recovery was impaired more by the presence of focal abnormal brain perfusion than by intracranial hypertension.
Oxygen and CO2 dissociation of duck blood was studied in blood samples equilibrated with known gas mixtures at the bird's body temperature (41 degrees C) and analyzed in the Van Slyke manometric apparatus and in pH electrodes.
At various pH values between 7.38 and 7.55 the Hill plots yielded straight and parallel lines over a wide range of O2 saturation, the Hill coefficient being 2.9.
Half saturation pressure P50 at pH = 7.50 was 36 torr.
The Bohr effect factor was -0.53.
Buffering properties were analyzed by equilibrating blood samples with gas mixtures of different PCO2 at 41 degrees C. The buffer value for whole blood in the range of 3-7% CO2 was 19.3 mMol-L-1-pH-1, the buffer value for true plasma 22.9 mMol-L-1-pH-1.
The CO2 dissociation curve constructed using the buffer values had a slope of 0.17 mMol-L-1-torr-1 in the PCO2 range from 40 to 50 torr.
The CO2 content of oxygenated blood at PCO2 = 40 torr was 21.7 mMol-L-1.
The Haldane effect factor at PCO2 = 35 torr equalled 0.30 mMol of combined CO2 per mMol HbO2.
With the values of PO2, PCO2 and pH measured in arterial blood of undisturbed and unrestrained, resting ducks effective dissociation curves for both O2 and CO2 were constructed assuming a metabolic R.Q.
The first apparent dissociation constant of carbonic acid, pK'1, of plasma and red cells was determined on venous blood of ten healthy, adult, male, human subjects.
pH and PCO2 of plasma and red cells were analyzed electrometrically and a micromanometric method was used for the determination of total carbon dioxide content.
Erythrocyte carbamino hemoglobin levels were estimated and used for the correction of erythrocyte pK'1.
Each blood sample was subjected to the following regimen before centrifugation, 1) As drawn from the antecubital vein, 2) Oxygenated with a 5% CO2, O2 balance gas mixture, and 3) Reduced with a 5% CO2, N2 balance gas mixture.
pK'1 of plasma and red cells are presented: (see article).
The consistently larger values for red cell pK'1 than the respective plasma data may be attributed to the greater amount of carbamino hemoglobin concentration present in the erythrocytes.
A simplified method for the calculation of erythrocyte bicarbonate concentration using the experimentally determined red cell pK'1 value has been formulated.
The method involves the use of a regression equation relating plasma and red cell pH, the equivalence of plasma and red cell PCO2, along with the experimentally determined red cell pK'1.
The effect of sustained hypercapnia on the acid-base balance and gill ventilation in rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, was studied.
The response to an increase in PICO2 from 0.3 to 5.2 mm Hg was a five-fold increase in gill ventilation volume and a slight increase in breathing frequency.
There was a concomitant rise in PACO2 and an immediate fall in pHa.
If PICO2 was maintained at 5.2 mm Hg for several days, ventilation volume gradually returned to the initial, prehypercapnic level within three days.
Arterial pH also returned to the initial level within 2-3 days.
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that under these conditions fish regulate pH via HCO3/C1 exchange across the gills rather than by changes in ventilation and subsequent adjustment of PACO2.
A reduction in environmental pH causes a reduction in pHa but only a slow gradual increase in VG.
Injections of HC1 or NaHCO3 into the blood have opposite effects on pHa but both cause a marked increase in VG.
It is concluded that a rise in PACO2 results in a rise in VG and that changes in pH in blood or water have little direct effect on VG in rainbow trout.
The relationship between pH and fluoride uptake in intact enamel of permanent premolars was investigated by using: (1) a sodium fluoride dentifrice, (2) a potassium fluoride + manganese chloride dentifrice, and (3) a sodium fluoride solution of the same fluoride concentration.
The first part of this paper deals with the in vitro uptake of fluoride from dentifrice slurries and from sodium fluoride solutions of different pH ranging from 7.1 to 4.5.
This investigation showed that there was no significant difference between the agents but that the effect of the pH was significant.
The uptake of fluoride in the form of fluorapatite was more than five times larger at the lower pH level.
The second part of the paper deals with the rate of fluoride uptake (increase in fluoride content) from dentifrices in the same pH range.
It was shown that the three agents gave the same initial rate of fluoride uptake (about 50 parts/10(6)/min) at pH 6 and that the rate of fluoride uptake in the outer layer of the enamel was proportional to the hydrogen ion activity.
The enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPiase, EC 3.6.1.1) from the odontoblastic layer of rat incisors has been studied by means of a radiochemical micromethod.
The enzyme was incubated with 32P-pyrophosphate in tris-HCl buffer at 37 degrees C. The reaction was linear with time for at least 45 min, and the pH optimum was found to be 8.8, independent of the amount of pyrophosphate present.
Heating the enzyme at 56 degrees C inhibited the enzyme activity rapidly, Mg2+ ions activated the enzyme by 15% at an ion concentration of 4 mM, while higher concentrations were inhibitory.
Ca2+ ions and PO43-ions inhibited the enzyme at all concentrations.
F- ions did not affect the PPiase at concentrations below 8 mM, whereas higher concentrations had an inhibiting effect.
Urea was found to inhibit the enzyme at concentrations above 1.5 M, while EDTA was a strong inhibitor at very low concentrations.
The characteristics of PPiase agree well with the properties of the enzyme nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1.)
To evaluate the "resting" pH and induced pH changes in denture plaque, soft deposits were collected from the fitting surface of the denture, pooled and suspended in water.
Plaque pH was determined with microelectrode equipment before and after mouth rinsing with a sucrose solution.
A characteristic level in the "resting" pH of denture plaque was found in most of 12 subjects tested.
pH values below the baseline level were recorded for more than 2 h after a rinse.
The pH depressions were more pronounced in maxillary than in mandibular plaque.
Further, the pH minima tended to be lower in subjects with denture stomatitis than in controls.
No clear relationship could be established between the "resting" pH and the concentration of Candida hyphae in denture smears or palatal inflammation.
A method is presented for the simultaneous assay of buccal enzymes by measuring reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and adenosine triphosphate with the aid of the bioluminescence of luciferase extracts.
The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was shown earlier to be increased in homogeneous leukoplakias of the oral mucosa.
Since smoking has been implicated as an etiologic factor of leukoplakia, G6PDH was measured in the normal buccal epithelium of cigarette smokers.
No difference was found in the activity of G6PDH between smokers and nonsmokers when related to the activity of pyruvate kinase, which is known to be invariable in healthy and leukoplakic oral mucosa.
A new compact kinetic luminescence analyzer is briefly described.
22 HL-A antigen and mixed leukocyte culture-matched sibling bone marrow transplants were attempted in patients with acute leukaemia (at the National Cancer Institute) to define the toxicities of four different immunosuppressive regimens, the complications associated with warrow engraftment and antileukaemic effect.
73% (16/22) were engrafted as indicated by a change to donor red blood cells (RBC) type, leukocyte, immunoglobulin allotype or by the speed of morrow repopulation and the occurrence of the Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD).
12 of 16 (75%) successful engrafted patients developed  GVHD.
The current published results of clinical bone marrow transplantation from major centers has been reviewed and will be discussed in relationship to current clinical complications associated with bone marrow transplantation.
Proper treatment of pneumonia is dependent upon a correct diagnosis.
Pneumonia may be due to infectious agents, allergic phenomena, or chemical causes.
Treatment regimens are outlined for the various types of pneumonia--pneumococcal, staphylococcal, fungal, and pneumonia due to gram-negative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, to Blastomyces dermatitidis, and to the parasite Pneumocystis carinii.
In discussing current concepts of treatment, several well-known methods are emphasized, as well as newer developments, knowledge of which is essential for optimal treatment of pneumonia.
A member of a family which was known to be susceptible to malignant hyperpyrexia, who was identified as a carrier by the presence of an elevated serum creatine-phosphokinase, has been investigated further.
Muscle was examined biochemically, and the study included the sarcoplasmic ATPase-activity, actinomycin, Mg2+ ATPase activity, ATP, phosphocreatine and glucose-6-phosphate.
In addition, the calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum was studied.
The histochemical analysis of the muscle revealed the presence of a new fibre type characterised by a dense rim of ATPase activity, which gives the impression of a 'picture-frame'.
Ultramicroscopic study revealed changes in the mitochondria and areas of myofibrillar disruption with swelling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
Such themes as maldistribution, service and education are discussed.
The first two phases of emptying have been computed by the method of least squares to obtain a logarithmic-linear pattern and are expressed as relative rates: The initial post-ingestion process is characterized by beta or the average relative rate of emptying in the first ten minutes, the basic or exponential rate as beta and the change in rate from the initial to basic pattern as deltabeta.
Each measure of gastric emptying was statistically analyzed to determine specific differences in rates between the operations studied.
Initial emptying after all three vagotomies is significantly faster than control with progressive rate increases as proximal gastric vagotomy is compared with selective gastric vagotomy with pyloroplasty and with truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty, probably indicative of gastric fundal loss of accommodation to volume distention after denervation.
The basic exponential pattern of emptying is not lost after any of the operations studied.
The basic rate after proximal gastric vagotomy and selective gastric vagotomy with pyloroplasty is nearly identical, slightly delayed from the control rate and significantly slower than the more rapid rate after truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty.
Elemental diets can maintain or slightly improve the nutritional status without a major stimulatory effect on the pancreas.
Six dogs were maintained with a regular chow diet, switched to an elemental diet and, subsequently, returned to a chow diet.
Cannulation of the pancreatic duct through a duodenal cutaneous fistula revealed the enzyme response to be decreased in a dog maintained with an elemental diet, with no or only a slight weight gain.
Return to a regular diet resulted in a return of pancreatic enzyme response.
Gastric juice from 15 normals, 20 patients with gastric ulcer and 14 patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis was investigated in respect of its activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates and its content of FDP and plasminogen or plasmin with immunochemical methods.
Gastric juice from normals showed no activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates, and no FDP or plasminogen could be demonstrated.
In the patients with gastric ulcer the gastric juice showed little or no fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates except in 2, who had regurgitation of duodenal juice and neutral pH of the juice.
These patients had equally high activity on heated as on unheated plates and no plasmin could be demonstrated.
It was shown that this activity was not due to fibrinolysis, but to non-specific proteolytic activity (probably trypsin).
The patients with erosive haemorrhage gastroduodenitis exhibited quite a different picture.
The gastric juice from these patients showed extremely high activity on fibrin plates, the activity was higher on unheated than on heated plates.
The activity was inhibited in vitro by addition of EACA and in vivo after administration of AMCA.
The occurence of plasmic could be demonstrated directly immunologically in the gastric juice.
By comparsion of plasmin and trypsin in various assays it could further be improved that the gastric juice in these cases contained plasminogen activator and plasmin.
The patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis showed no increase in fibrinolysis in the blood, but low values for plasminogen and alpha2-M, and the serum contained FDP.
These findings in the blood and gastric juice were interpreted as signs of local fibrinolysis in the stomach and duodenum.
There is reason to assume that this gastric fibrinolysis contributes substantially to the bleeding tendency.
The effect of administration of AMCA on fibrinolytic activity and the haemorrhage lends support to the assumption of such a mechanism.
The effect of  prolonged (10 days) dehydration on acid-base parameters of camel blood was examined.
The pH and PCO2 levels rose significantly in the course of dehydration.
This state was comparable with compensated non-respiratory alkalosis found in other animals.
The plasma sodium, and magnesium levels rose significantly also.
The plasma oxygen and calcium levels declined significantly.
There were no significant changes in potassium and phosphate levels.
It is concluded that the changes found in acid-base status following dehydration are further evidence of water preservation mechanisms in the dehydrated camel.
50 transplantations of homologous vein grafts in reconstruction of arteries are reported on.
Vein grafts were either transplanted immediately or used after deep freezing.
This procedure has proved to be effective in the replacement of arteries during our observation period of four years.
Results of homologous vein transplants are similar to those of autologous transplants.
The hydrogen clearance method was used to measure local and total cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the rhesus monkey before and for five hours after a simulated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
CBF remained stable after SAH unless SAH was associated with a fall in cerebral perfusion pressure.
In addition, cerebrovascular resistance did not increase after SAH.
These results suggest that vasoactive agents in fresh whole blood, and the arterial spasm they produce when added to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), play only a limited role in the pathogenesis of ischemic encephalopathy that follows an SAH.
The effect of oxygen saturation and PCO2 on brain uptake of glucose analogues was studied in rabbits.
Using a modified Oldendorf technique, 14C-labeled glucose analogues with a 3H2O reference standard were introduced into the cerebral circulation via the common carotid artery, and the radioactivity of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex was counted and expressed in terms of a brain uptake index (BUI).
Severe hypoxia (oxygen saturation less than or equal to 18%) resulted in approximately a 40% decrease in the BUI of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and a 45% decrease in the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose.
Severe hypercapnia (PCO2 = 100 mm Hg) caused a 45% decrease in the BUI of both of these glucose analogues.
Hypercapnia superimposed on severe hypoxia had no additional effect.
Hypocapnia (PCO2 = 15 mm Hg) increased the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose by 35% of the control value, and this increase was extremely sensitive to competitive inhibition.
When BUI values were plotted against pH rather than PCO2 for the same experiments, there was a good correlation with the calculated linear regression.
These results are compared with previous findings on pathologically induced changes in brain uptake of glucose analogues, and the possible role of blood flow is considered in detail.
The effect of blood injected into either subarachnoid space or subcortical brain tissue upon lactate and pyruvate concentrations as well as acid-base balance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was studied in the anesthetized dog.
CSF lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) increased progressively following the intracranial injection of blood and reached the maximum level at six hours after injection.
These changes were significantly greater in animals with intracerebral hematoma than in those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
An increase in CSF lactate and L/P ratio in hemorrhagic CSF seems to be caused by two different factors.
Shed blood cells per se produce lactate and pyruvate, and blood in the subarachnoid space and intracerebral hematomas cause secondary changes in brain tissue metabolism by a probable reduction of cerebral blood flow.
Therefore, an increase in CSF lactate with a concomitant rise in CSF L/P ratio is a useful indicator for brain tissue hypoxia, even when CSF is hemorrhagic.
The association of an increase in CSF lactate to a disproportionate decrease in CSF HCO-3 was also observed in these animals.
The effect of variables associated with the donor and with methods of collecting, processing, and storing platelets on the quality of platelets kept at ambient temperature was studied.
Changes in structural integrity of platelets, decrease in pH, loss of aggregability, and kinetics in vivo of platelets tagged with 51Cr were used as indicators of the tolerance of platelets to storage.
A platelet concentration of less than 2.5 x 10(6) per cu mm, a temperature of storage less than 24 C, and continuous, gentle, agitation were found to be essential for satisfactory preservation of platelet integrity, function, and post-transfusion survival.
Platelets from female donors tolerated storage less well than did platelets from male donors, possibly because the lower hematocrit of blood collection from females resulted in greater initial acidity of the concentrate.
A number of other variables analyzed appear to be of little or no consequence for successful platelet storage.
Resistance to allogeneic bone-marrow grafts (AR) was found to occur in many species, including the dog.
administration of silica particles suppressed AR in vivo in this species.
Genetic studies provide suggestive evidence for the existence of a previously unrecognized system or systems in the canine major histocompatibility complex controlling AR.
Tne ultrastructural and fluorescence histochemical characteristics of the mature rabbit substantia nigra and neostriatum have been reviewed as a frame of reference for the developmental study.
Biochemical investigations were reported on neostriatal dopamine concentrations and the relative uptake and accumulation of 3H-dopamine by this tissue from fetal to adult stages, to provide quantitative data for correlation with the fluorexcence information.
The development of the neurons of the substantia nigra and their axons which project to the neostriatum has been presented from their appearance at day 14 of gestation to their maturation in early postnatal life.
The initial bipolar neuroblasts, which develop in the midline of the caudal mesencephalon, are fluorescent as soon as they emerge from the ependymal zone.
Their fluorescent axons, which form the nigroneostriatal pathway, reach the telencephalon at day 16 of gestation and ramify extensively in the putamen by day 20, but do not enter the caudate nucleus until several days later.
Some of the early fluorescent axonal profiles in the putamen are extremely large.
Electron microscopic study of theis stage suggests that the large fluorescent profiles may correspond to axonal growth cones or early synapses.
A distinct substantia nigra, pars compacta and reticulata, can be recognized by fluorescence microscopy by day 20 of gestation.
Electron microscopy reveals that the young neurons are multipolar with numerous developing dendrites, some of which exhibit early synaptic junctions.
The subsequent maturaition of these cells and the neuropil is described.
The fluorescent axons of the substantia nigra grow into the putamen and caudate nucleus in a nonuniform manner forming fluorescent islands throughout the neostriatum in late fetal life.
These profiles might correspond to some of the axons with varicosities "en passage" revealed by electron microscopy.
In an attempt to identify further the dopamine-containing axon, the ultratructure of adult neostriatum incubated in 5-hydroxydopamine was reported.
Axonal varicosities "en passage" containing a dense "tag" in the vesicles were found.
Most of the tagged boutons did not exhibit synaptic contacts.
The possible significance of these finding s as related to dopamine secretion are discussed.
A comparative study of rat adenohypophysis extract and its alcohol fractions was performed by two variants of the method of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel: at pH 9,5 and with the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate at pH 7.2.
With the presence of sodium dodecylsulphate four protein zones are found which in the order from the anode towards the cathode are identified as hemoglobin, somatotropin, lactotropin and albumin.
It is shown that the somatotropin zone after the extract separation at pH 9.5 is inhomogeneous and consists of somatotropin and hemoglobin.
Certain properties of the rat liver cell nuclei NAD-glycohydrolase (EC 3.2.2.5) were investigated.
It is established that its highest activity is at 37 degrees with activation energy equal to 9480 cal/M and with factor Q10 equal to 1.5.
The enzyme pH optimum in 0.2 M tris acetate is equal to 6.5 and in 0.2 potassium phosphate - 7.5.
It was shown that the enzyme manifests its strict specificity only with beta-NAD, and it hardly decomposes NADP without affecting NADH, NADPH and NMN.
The apparent Km value of the enzyme with respect to NAD is established.
Isonicotinic acid hydrazide, nicotinamide and to the less extent nicotinic acid inhibit the enzymatic activity of nuclei.
EDTA, EGTA, p-CMB, mercaptoethanol do not cause any changes in the rat liver cells nuclei NADase activity.
A comparative study was carried out of some properties of "soluble" Na+, K+-ATPase obtained from different subcellular membrane brain structures by means of non-ionic detergents of triton X-100 and digitonin.
It is established that temperature and pH-optima of "soluble" Na+, K+-ATPase are close to these optima of the initial membrane preparations.
A certain difference is observed in the dynamics of temperature and pH-dependence of Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the extracts from different subcellular structures.
The stability of the preparations in storage was investigated.
A conclusion is made that more stable enzyme extracts may be obtained by means of digitonin.
When investigating activity of glutamine synthetase of the enzymatic preparations isolated from the brain of rats of 0.5, 1, 3, 12 and 24-month age, no considerable differences were found in the indices of the values Km to a-glutamate and Vmax which are respectively equal to: Km (M-10(-3))=5.5; 3.5; 3.6; 3.9; 5.5; Vmax=3.1; 4.5; 5.0; 5.2 muM were found.
When adding various concentrations of a-ketoglutaric acid into the incubation medium the differences are registered in the degree and character of the age changes in brain glutamine synthetase activity in comparison with this enzyme form the liver.
Certain characteristics of chicken liver cells nuclei NAD-pyrophosphorylase (NMN-adenylytranspherase, EC 2.7.7.1) were investigated.
It was established that NAD-pyrophosphorylase activity optimum pH is within interval of 7.0-7.5; temperature optimum - 38-39 degrees C; factor Q10 is equal to 2.
Enzyme activation energy, inactivation energy and enthalpy were calculated; apparent Km values of NAD-pyrophosphorylase with respect to NMN and ATP are equal to 1.62-10(-7) M and 2.61-10(-7) M, respectively.
The nature of riboflavin precursors was studied in the yeast Pichia guilliermondii.
By means of mutants with blocked GMP-synthetase the purine precursors of riboflavin were shown to belong to guanylic compounds.
Accumulation of 2,4,5-triamino-6-oxypyrimidine, 2,5-diamino-6-oxy-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine, 2,6-dioxy-5-amino-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine (DOARAP) and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumasine occurs in the riboflavin-deficient mutants divided into five biochemical groups.
This fact evidences for identity of riboflavin precursors in the yeast P. guilliermondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Synthesis of DOARAP by the washed off cells of the mutants with the blocked lumasine synthetase is strongly inhibited by riboflavin; cycloheximide in the absence of riboflavin has no effect on this process.
Consequently, flavinogenesis in P. guilliermondii is regulated according to the type of negative feedback by means of retroinhibition mechanism.
A change in the content of flavins in the cells has no effect on synthesis of riboflavin synthetase; at the same time iron deficiency in the cells evokes derepression of this enzyme.
Incubation of the cells rich in iron with o-phenantroline or alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl also causes derepression of riboflavin synthetase which is inhibited by cycloheximide.
A deficiency of hem in the mutants which need epsilon-aminolevulinic acid does not affect the riboflavinsynthetase activity of the cells.
Evidently, in P. guilliermondii a certain form of nonheminic iron might take part in regulating synthesis of riboflavin synthetase and other enzymes participating in riboflavin biosynthesis.
Riboflavin overproduction is established to require formation of purines de novo.
With the absence of flavinogenesis enzymes derepression a genetic disturbance in regulation of purinic nucleotides biosynthesis results in stimulation of flavinogenesis.
The properties were studied for 680 time purified riboflavinkinase from cells of P. guilliermondii as well as for three phosphatases possessing the optimum of the activity at pH 3.5, 5.5 and 8.6, which ARE ABLE OF HYDROLYSING FMN.
A change in the content of flavins and iron in the cells has no effect on the activity of riboflavinkinase in this species.
Evidently, the mechanisms of riboflavin and flavin nucleotides biosynthesis regulation would be different in P. guilliermondii.
The pH optima were determined for DNases and RNases of the loach eggs.
It is established that Ca++ activates, and Fe++ has not effect on the activity of acid and alkaline DNases, while Mg++, Mn++ and especially Co++, Zn++, Cd++, Cu++ have an inhibitory effect on them.
The activities of RNases is stimulated by Ca++ and Fe++, and inhibited by Zn++, Co++, Cd++ and Cu++.
Iones Mg++ and Mn++ do not affect these activities.
Localization of the above mentioned enzymes was studied by means of differential centrifugation of egg homogenates.
Acid DNase is concentrated only in postmicrosomal supernatant liquid, its activity being inhibited in the presence of the nucleomitochondrial and microsomal fractions.
Acid RNase is also localized predominantly in postmicrosomal supernatant fraction.
Alkaline DNase is found to a great extent in nucleomitochondrial fraction, and alkaline RNase - in postmicrosomal one.
The optimal conditions are selected for electron-cytochemical detection of the ATPase activity in nuclei of the skeletal muscles of rabbits and nuclei of Vicia faba L. meristem.
It is shown that the previous fixation of nuclei in the rabbit skeletal muscle for 10 min in a mixture of the buffer solutions of 4% glutaric dialdehyde and 4% neutral formalin (1:1) causes a decrease in their ATPase activity by 78% in the medium containing Mg2+ and by 34% - in the medium containing Ca2+; in nuclei of horse bean seedlings meristem it lowers respectively by 28 and 16%.
Ions of lead in a concentration of 0.4 mM evoke a decrease in the ATPase activity in the medium containing Mg2+, in nuclei of the rabbit skeletal muscles by 35% and in nuclei of horse bean meristem by 15% in the medium containing Ca2+.
The vaule of the residual activity is sufficient for detection of the product of ATP enzymic hydrolysis reaction by activity is sufficient for detection of the product of ATP enzymic hydrolysis reaction by the method of electronic cytochemistry.
An increase in the Pb2+ concentration higher than 2.8 mM evokes nonenzymic hydrolysis of ATP.
The ATPase activity under the electron-cytochemical study is found within the range of pH 6.3-8.5.
The product of reaction forms most intensively at pH 7.2-7.5 in the medium with both Mg2+ and Ca2+.
In experiments on 30 animals and in observations over the course of acute closed craniocerebral trauma in 24 patients is was found that the course and prognosis of a posttraumatic period were dependent on the functional activity of the sympathoadrenal system and cholin- and serotoninergic processes.
Based on the data obtained, it is concluded that the character of neurohumoral interrelations can serve as the prognostic criterion in craniocerebral traumas, whereas the information about these processes--in selecting the appropriate therapy.
Among 206 examined patients with cholecystitis and similar diseases in 112 (65%) cases, as evidenced by the authors' findings, the gallbladder proved to be non-functioning.
Its escape in the biliary system was functional (indirect) or organic (absolute).
The main causes of a direct organic escape of the gallbladder are as follows: destructive changes in its walls, strictures, strangulated gall stones, shrinkage or hydropsy.
The reliable preoperative diagnosis of an escaped gallbladder by means of accelerated chromoduodenal catheterization, intravenous (infusion-drip) or associated (intravenous-peroral) cholecystocholangiography, correlated with the anamnesis data and clinical signs, rather speaks in favour of cholecystectomy on absolute indications.
There is a description of the determination of the enzymatic activity of acid proteinases: the method is based on the use of 125J-labelled natural protein substrates.
Labelled albumin 125J, globulin 125J, and insulin 125J were tested for the determination of activities.
All the substrates were hydrolyzed with the enzymes of the supernatant fraction (106 000 g) of beff liver homogenate in the zone of acid pH.
Optimum comditions of enzymatic reaction were tested, the dependence of reaction on the concentration of the enzyme, on time, and on temperature was determined, pH optimum was ascertained for individual substrates, and pH stability was determined.
It follows from the results that the method is suitable for the determination of the enzymatic activity of proteinases of the cathepsin character.
Serum pepsinogen  estimations from serially bled lambs grazing on pasture from spring to autumn showed correlations with the availability of Ostertagia larvae on pasture, with faecal egg counts of O circumcincta, and with Ostertagia worm counts in similar lambs slaughtered fort-nightly from the same pasture.
In the slaughtered lambs correlations were recorded between worm count, serum pepsinogen level and abomasal pH.
The value of serum pepsinogen estimations as a diagnostic test is discussed with reference to these findings.
Studied was the possibility to isolate and culture Tr.
gallinarum and Tr.
tenax on a medium Trimed, proposed by the authors for the isolation and cultivation of Tr.
The growth and development of the two Trichomonas species were followed up at various temperatures -- 38 degrees, 36 degrees, and 32 degrees C, in order to establish the most appropriate temperature for continuous cultivation at longer intervals of reseeding as well as the temperature optimum for the fast deposition of great amounts of biomass.
It was found that the Trimed medium is suitable for the isolation and cultivation of Tr.
gallinarum and Tr.
Temperatures of 38 degrees and 36 degrees contribute to the accumulation of greater amounts of biomass, while at 32 degrees C the growth of these protozoa is delayed and reseeding is to be carried out at greater intervals.
alpha-Amylase of the thermophilic actinomycete Thermomonospora vulgaris was partially purified.
Maximal enzyme activity was obtained at 60degreeC and pH 6.0.
KM value was l.4%.
The effect of some metal salts on enzyme activity was studied.
Enzyme activity was inhibited by by KCN, EDTA, and iodoacetate.
Inhibition by EDTA was completely nullified by CaCl2, but the inhibition by iodoacetate was not overcome by 2-mercaptoethanol.
Exposure of the enzyme to pH 7.0 and 9.0 for 2 hr.
did not affect the enzyme, but exposure to pH 3.0 for few minutes completely inactivated the enzyme.
Exposure of the enzyme to 60degreeC resulted in an appreciable inactivation and exposure to 80degreeC completely inactivated the enzyme.
However, bovine serym albumin had a protective effect when the enzyme was exposed to 60degreeC but not to 80degreeC.
The enzyme was stable in the presence of 8 M urea.
8 patients with chronic pyelonephritis were given gentamycin intramuscularly injected in individual dosage during 8-10 days.
Here the behaviour of the excretion of protein, alanine aminopeptidase alkaline phosphatase, alpha-glucosidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and lysozyme with the urine was tested.
With the exception of the lysozymuria, which increased only in patients with chronic renal insufficiency, regularly a hyperenzymuria developed.
Most distinctly the excretion of the alanine aminopeptidase increased.
After initial decrease the excretion of total protein transiently increased after completion of the gentamycin therapy.
All the deviations were reversible.
From the increased excretion of enzymes may not be concluded to a nephrotoxicity of gentamycin.
Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) in extracts of human feces resembles alkaline phosphatase in extracts of duodenal mucosa, except for its electrophoretic mobility in starch gel.
It is very probable that the normal feces alkaline phosphatase derives from intestinal mucosa.
Gall bladder alkaline phosphatase, which is markedly different, has not been found in normal feces.
Some patients with acute viral hepatitis or protozoasis excrete an alkaline phosphatase which resembles gall bladder alkaline phosphatase and has the characteristics of 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5).
The appearance of this enzyme correlates with low total alkaline phosphatase activity of the excreta.
A simple method is described for the simultaneous determination of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) and 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) in serum.
The method is based on the determination of inorganic phosphorus released by the action of the two enzymes on adenosine-5'-monophosphate at pH 9.5 (200 mmol/l tris-buffer) in the presence and absence of L-cysteine.
This amino acid at a concentration of 2--10 mmol/l was found to be a specific inhibitor for alkaline phosphatase but with no effect on 5'-nucleotidase activity.
The uptake of the shortest six fatty acids (acetic to octanoic) was studied in vitro, using everted segments of rat jejunum.
The marked influence of medium-pH and fatty acid chain-length suggests that non-ionic diffusion through the lipoid membrane is quantitatively the most important way of transport, but ionic diffusion through the membrane as well as transport through hydrophilic pores also seem to play a role.
Though fatt acids evidently are accumulated in the tissue-fluid, and saturation kinetics, competitive inhibition and sodium- as well as energy-dependence apparently are observed, the transport mechanism is assumed to involve solely passive diffusion, - the concept of a carrier-mediated transport for short and medium chain fatty acids seems improbable.
The reaction of the analgesic amidopyrine (100 mg) with nitrite extracted from cured meats and from spinach in varying degrees of spoilage was studied.
Unde physiological conditions the carcinogenic dimethylnitrosamine was formed at milligram levels at nitrite concentrations as low as 4 mg (in 175 ml extracted from 100 g boiled ham).
The rate of decrease in concentration in the human stomach after ingestion of amidopyrine and of nitrite contained in boiled ham or in a broth from boiled ham was also measured.
The author describes a very rapid and accurate method of determining the acidity of gastric juice which is based on recent findings.
Starting from the electrometrically determined pH value and the volume of the gastric juice, the actual hydrogenion concentration may be read from a table.
The laboratory work is considerably simplified by this method.
phosphorylase, aldose, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and a key enzyme of the pentose phosphatase cycle, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), in the hepatopancreas of Scylla serrata (Forskal).
Weak activities of phosphorylase and aldolase and strong-activities of alpha-GPDH and LDH were noticed mainly in the brush border of the tubules and R-cell cytoplasm.
A trace activity of G-6-PDH was noticed in the brush border.
Bilateral eyestalk removal results in inhibition of both phosphorylase and aldolase.
However, enhanced activities of alpha-GPDH and LDH were noticeable 4 h after the operation.
Injection of eyestalk extract into both intact and destalked crabs activated all the enzymes.
Authors applied blood-gas analysis in 30 healthy gravid women on 3,3 occassions making out 90 cases altogether by blood samples taken from the pulp of the finger capillaries.
As a control 27 healthy non-gravid women were examined for comparative analysis.
In 10 cases between the 16. and 28. week the results of samples taken from the arteria femoralis and the pulp were evaluated.
It has been found that in the gravidity period of the 16. and 28. week respiratory alcalosis does not appear.
The parallel examination of blood samples taken from the arteria femoralis and the pulp have proved that it is sufficient and reliable to take blood-gas analysis on the material gained from the pulp capillary only.
A special importance is attached to keeping to exact methodical prescriptions.
Antigens from disrupted cells of dysentery-provoking and of non-enteropathogenic Escherichieae were submitted to immunoelectrophoresis on cellulose acetate stripes at pH 8.0.
Among 6 immune sera produced for this purpose by immunizing rabbits against desintegrated dysentery bacteria, only one contained a precipitine reacting with an antigen similar to the "generic antigen" of BELAYA.
This - at pH 8.0 - cathode-bound group antigen (KGA) could not only be found in virulent but also in 5 attenuated cultures and in 5 from 6 avirulent strains of several dysentery types.
Only the - apathogenic - type culture 1111/55 of dysentery-provoking E. coli O 136 showed no KGA-reaction.
B. pertussis suspension was tested by De Voe et al.
method (1970) and its modification with the solutions of a definite ionic composition and a lysozyme.
The suspension was washed 4 times with the same solution and then the precipitate was suspended in saccharose solution (0.5 M).
In 2 hours the saccharose was replaced by a solution of salts with lysozyme.
After a 2-hour incubation at 35 degrees C the substance was centrifugated for 20 minutes and the precipitate suspended in the tris-buffer at pH 7.8.
The following changes were observed: after the washing and incubation with saccharose there was seen a strong stretching and separation of the cell wall (CW) from the cytoplasmic membrane (CPM); cells without the CW were rarely revealed; 2) after the lysozyme treatment there were many cells of spherical shape (phasic-contrast microscopy) without any CW, limited by the CPM only.
Morphologically they were no different from the true protoplasts of the Gram-positive bacteria.
The chemical analysis also confirmed a possibility of obtaining the true protoplasts of the Gram-negative bacteria.
Experiments were carried out on linear mice immunized with sheep erythrocytes; it was found that the primary immune respose developed against the background of significant changes in the state of the sympathico-adrenal system, whose activity was determined by the dynamics of catecholamines in the blood and in the tissues of a number of organs, including the thymus, the spleen and the lymph nodes.
By comparing the value of specific and neurohumoral indices it was revealed that the neurohumoral shifts preceded the maximal development of the immune response.
On the example of studying the catecholamine dynamics the opinion on a close association between the state of the regulatory mechanisms and the effector formations responsible for the formation of specific immunological reactions was confirmed.
It is suggested that a full-value immunological response developed on condition of activation of the sympathico-adrenal system.
The properties of peroxidase insolubilized by covalent binding to CH- and AH-Sepharose 4 B in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) are described.
CH-Sepharose 4 B bound peroxidase yields an enzyme preparation with a residual specific activity of 60.6%.
When bound to AH-Sepharose 4 B, the residual specific activity is to 78%.
By covalent binding on CH- and AH-Sepharose 4 B, peroxidase exibits no changes in its pH optimum; it virtually keeps the same activity after being used ten times.
Insolubilized peroxidase preparations, dried and reimbibed after being stored for 6 weeks at room temperature still display 50% of the initial specific activity of the insolubilized enzyme.
Stored in acetate buffer, the enzyme preparations maintain their activity during all this interval.
A method for the preparation of a 150-fold purified and homogenous A. aerogenes urease is reported.
The enzyme exhibited two pH optima at pH 7.0 and 7.5 in triethanolamine and phosphate buffer, respectively.
The affinity of the enzyme toward its substrate increased with the increase of pH.
No effect of the pH was observed on the measured temperature coefficient (Q10).
There was no discontinuity in the Arrhenius plots at pH 5.4 and 7.5 but an upward discontinuity at pH 6.15 and 8.7 with transition temperature at 30 degrees C. Also, the calculated activation energies are greatly affected by the pH of the enzyme reaction mixture.
The behaviour and properties of membrane-bound GAPDH of rabbit reticulocytes were investigated.
The bound GAPDH is more resistant to inactivation by KCl than the soluble enzyme (allotopy).
The bound enzyme is released by electrolytes.
This effect does not only depend on the ionic strength but additionally on the kind of ions, pH-value and protein concentration.
A comparison of the releasing effect of NAD analogues shows the necessity of the 5'-AMP moiety in the structure of the effector.
The represented results demonstrate the specifity of the GAPDH-membrane binding in rabbit reticulocytes.
By quantitative stimulation of the vagus nerves of isolated rabbit atria frequency-response relations were obtained for both the electrotropic effect (reduction of the area of the monophasic action potential) and the inotropic response.
An addition of hexamethonium in a final concentration of 10(-5) g/ml resulted in a diminution of vagal effectivity in the range of lower and medium frequencies of stimulation, and was connected with a shift of the frequency-response characteristic to the right.
At higher frequencies vagal effectivity was increased.
In contrast to the inhibitory effect of hexamethonium the facilitating action is irreversible.
By raising the concentration up to 4-10(-5) g/ml the vagal effects were reduced to a large extent, and the frequency dependence of the response was abolished at medium frequencies.
In the range of 20 sec(-1) to 100 sec(-1) this dependence was re-established and may be considered as a part of a normal frequency-response relation extremely shifted to the right.
A mathematical handling of the frequency-response characteristics provides quantitative evidence for the extent of the hexamethonium blockade of vagal ganglion cells in the atria; furthermore it leads to the conception of these cells to act as a distributing system for a homogeneous innervation by a widespread divergency of postganglionic fibres.
Several years ago, Theorell and Czerlinski conducted experiments on the system of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and imidazole, using the first version of the temperature jump apparatus with detection of changes in fluorescence.
However, the improved detection system allowed to measure a slight concentration dependence of the relaxation time of around 3 ms.
Furthermore, the chemical relaxation time was smaller than the one determined earlier (by factor 2).
The data were evaluated much more rigorously than before, allowing an appropriate interpretation of the results.
The observed relaxation time is largely due to rate constants in an interconversion of ternary complexes, which are faster than three (of the four) dissociation rate constants, determined previously by Theorell and McKinley-McKee.1,2 This fact contributed to earlier difficulties of finding any concentration dependence.
However, the binding of imidazole to the binary enzyme-coenzyme complex can be made to couple kinetically into the interconversion rate of the two ternary complexes.
The observed signal derives largely from the ternary complex(es).
A substantial fluorescence signal change is associated with the observed relaxation process, suggesting a relocation of the imidazole in reference to the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme.
Nine models are considered with two types of coupling of pre-equilibria (none-all).
Quantitative evaluations favor the model with two ternary complexes connected by an interconversion outside the four-step (bimolecular) cycle.
The ternary complex outside the cycle has much higher fluorescence yield than the one inside.
The interconversion equilibrium is near unity for imidazole.
If it would be shifted very much to the side of the "dead-end" complex (as in isobutyramide?!
The author shows complex analyses: clinical, laboratory, X-rays, bronchoscopical, bronchographical and measuring lung function tests as well as the serological examinations in blood serum of both groups of asthmatic and nonasthmatic children with virological infection.
The calculation of statistically significant differences between the various diagnostical results of both groups has confirmed that in asthmatic children virological infection of the respiratory tract, pathological findings in X-ray and lung function tests, bronchiectasis and secondary bacteriological invasion occurs statistically significantly more often than in nonasthmatic children.
A group of proteins was readily extracted at neutrality from trichloroacetic acid precipitates of staphylococcal culture filtrate supernatants, while alpha-toxin was dissolved and activated by treating the precipitate with 8 M urea, with acidic buffers or by heating to 90-100 degrees C at neutrality.
Heat activation of the precipitate produced a relatively pure alpha-toxin with a molecular weight of 39,000. alpha-Toxin was eluted together with three other proteins on hydroxyl apatite chromatography, and evidence was obtained for an association between the four proteins.
On isoelectric focusing a haemolytic fraction was obtained at pH 6.2, probably due to acid activation of the precipitate formed at the cathodic end of the column.
The alpha-haemolytic fractions with pI's of 7.4 and 8.6 were shown to consist of alpha-toxin only when analyzed by acrylamide electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate.
The haemolytic component with a pI of 9.2 contained two additional components of molecular weights of 27,500 and 18,000.
Chromatography of this material on Sephadex G-200 showed that alpha-toxin and the two proteins appeared as a high molecular complex.
A series of episodes of acute otitis media was studied with reference to bacterial findings and specific serological responses in 48 children with histories of frequent episodes before.
Re-isolations after therapy were often made in episodes with slow healing or therapeutic failure.
Most children harboured pathogens in nasopharynx even when they had no signs of respiratory tract infections.
D. pneumococcus type 3 and H. influenzae type b generally provoked antibody response.
No levels indicating immunoglobulin deficiencies could be found in the children.
The relationship between the soft coral Sarcothelia edmondsoni Verrill and its symbiotic algae is considered as an early instance of cellular tolerance which can be disturbed by a variety of adverse conditions.
Their expulsion appears to be a reverse translocation to the distal end of the host cell and escape by a form of reversed phagocytosis resembling secretion.
An epizoodemic of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), subtype I variant B, occurred in Ecuador during the rainy and hot season of 1969.
In this paper, a general description of the epidemic is given and virus isolations from humans are reported.
A serologic survey was performed in order to determine the extension of the epidemic along the coastal zone of the country.
It is not clear whether the higher antibody rate in older people was because they were at greater risk of infection or was the result of an accumulated immunity with time.
The latter could be an indication of endemic virus activity, not yet proven for the VEE IB virus variant.
Maternal dose--fetal teratogenic response data were obtained for a variety of narcotic and related compounds by single subcutaneous injections of the drugs into pregnant hamsters during the critical periods of central nervous system organogenesis.
The number of abnormal fetuses from females injected with diacetylmorphine (heroin), thebaine, phenazocine, pentazocine, propoxyphene, and methadone increased as the maternal dose of the compounds was increased.
By contrast, morphine, hydromorphone, and meperidine produced an increase in the number (per cent) of fetal anomalies only up to a certain maternal dose level.
Further increases in maternal dose levels did not produce additional fetal anomalies.
The narcotic antagonists nalorphine, naloxone, levallophan, and cyclazocine blocked the teratogenic effects of both single and multiple doses of the narcotics.
A screening method designed for administration by lay personnel is evaluated and compared to Modified Clinical Technique screening results for a screening of 1600 elementary school children.
Simultaneous perfusion to proximal convoluted tubules and peritubular capillaries was used to study the effects of different perfusion fluids on sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion, which was calculated as bicarbonate reabsorption and titratable acid.
Results show that sodium reabsorption was not tightly coupled to hydrogen secretion.
Bicarbonate stimulates both sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion, but Tris stimulates only sodium reabsorption.
Imposing an adverse chloride gradient across the proximal tubule (C1- peritubular greater than C1- luminal) decreased sodium reabsorption but did not diminish hydrogen secretion.
Diamox inhibited both net sodium and hydrogen transport.
It is concluded that there is not firm linkage between sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion and that bicarbonate probably stimulates sodium transport by a number of mechanisms, including an effect on the sodium transport unrelated to its ability to increase hydrogen ion secretion.
The extracellular space (ECS) of muscle from each ventricle of the heart (RV and LV), the atria, diaphragm, and quadriceps was estimated in the anesthetized rabbit from the distribution volumes of [14C]insulin, [14C]sucrose, [51Cr]EDTA, and C1--.
Whole-tissue electrolytes were measured and intracellular electrolytes calculated.
The ECS of the tissues varied, increasing in the order quadriceps less than LV less than RV less than atria.
The volume of distribution of [14C]inulin was always less than that of either [14C]sucrose or [51Cr]EDTA which agreed closely, whereas that of C1-- was always greater.
There was no difference in intracellular K+ in muscle from each of the cardiac chambers, whereas intracellular Na+ and C1-- varied, increasing in the order quadriceps less than LV less than RV less than atria.
Intracellular pH, measured with [14C]DMO did not differ in any of the tissues studied.
It is concluded that, in vivo, the estimated ECS incardiac muscle is lower than that reported in vitro, that [51Cr]EDTA is a satisfactory ECS marker, and that differences in intracellular Na+ and C1-- but not K+ or pH exist between muscle from the cardiac chambers.
The effects of a metabolic and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis on intracellular pH (pHi) and K+ have been compared in cardiac and skeletal muscle from the anesthetized rabbit.
The extracellular space and pHi were calculated from the distribution volumes of [51Cr] EDTA and [14C]DMO, respectively.
When pHe was varied by altering PCO2, the slope of the line relating pHi to the extracellular pH (pHe) was greater (P less than 0.05--0.001) than that obtained during metabolic changes of pHe in right and left ventricles, atria, diaphragm, and quadriceps.
During metabolic acidosis and alkalosis, the slope of pHi/pHe line did not vary between tissues.
During respiratory acidosis, there was no difference in slope between cardiac tissues, but it was less in left ventricle than quadriceps (P less than 0.001).
In left ventricle intracellular K+ increased in a metabolic (P less than 0.05) or respiratory acidosis (P less than 0.02), whereas in diaphragm it decreased (P less than 0.02).
Intracellular K+ correlated with pHe and pHE-PHi.
Changes in pHi but not intracellular K+ could explain known differences in myocardial function in respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
Isolated canine atrial plateau fibers were treated with acetylcholine or norepinephrine to note the effects on the transmembrane potential.
Acetylcholine, 1.0 or 2.0 mug/ml, consistently reduced the slope of inherent phase 4 depolarization.
Pretreatment with atropine, 1.0 mug/ml, prevented these responses, and alone this drug had no discernible effect.
Norepinephrine consistently increased the slope of phase 4 depolarization.
"Arrhythmias" characterized by spontaneous excitations were induced in 92% of the norepinephrine experiments.
Norepinephrine also enhanced the plateau phase of the action potential and decreased the rising velocity and overshoot.
Racemic propranolol, 1.0 mug/ml, blocked all the above effects including arrhythmias.
Dextropropranolol, 1.0 mug/ml, did not block effects produced by norepinephrine.
Acetylcholine, applied to fibers under treatment with norepinephrine, reduced the slope of norepinephrine-induced phase 4 depolarization and terminated induced arrhythmias.
The interstitial fluid pressure of the submucosa of the gastric fundus was monitored by means of Guyton's capsules in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital.
The intracapsular pressure (ICP) was measured during secretion produced by: a) hypertonic solutions placed inside the stomach; b) arterial hypertension (200 mmHg) applied during intra-arterial infusion of histamine, and c) intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine.
The first procedure did not modify the ICP.
On the other hand, whenever interstitial fluid appeared in the gastric lumen during hypertension plus histamine, the mean ICP increased, mostly due to augmented capillary filtration.
The hydraulic coefficient measured in these experiments was at least 4 orders of magnitude larger than the respective osmotic coefficient.
The action of acetylcholine was complex: large doses enlarged the net capillary filtration, but small doses increased the mean ICP by muscle stimulation only.
Contraction of the muscularis mucosae might be the most important mechanism underlying bulk flow of interstitial fluid in physiological conditions.
It is concluded that hydraulic gradients across the epithelium might account for the "secretion" of "alkaline" juice.
Hospital psychiatry has evolved from long-term "treatment" programs that were primarily custodial to the successful pharmacological treatment of acute psychotic episodes.
This so-called revolving door syndrome draws attention to the critical importance of preventing as well as treating acute episodes.
In the first part of this overview, the author reviews the clinical literature on prophylactic treatment of schizophrenia with maintenance antipsychotic drugs.
The second part will review the literature on prophylactic treatment of affective disorders with lithium and tricyclics.
In the opinion of the author these drugs provide the potential for truly preventive psychiatry.
Antidepressants were given less often than would be justified by the incidence of depressive illness among these patients.
Nonrecognition of depression in patients with somatic complaints and autonomic signs of depression contributed to this lack of treatment.
In 14 patients undergoing surgery with methoxyflurane anaesthesia the development of metabolic acidosis was observed.
As mechanisms causing such acidosis regional ischaemia and inhibition of lactic acid metabolism in the liver by breakdown products of methoxyflurane are discussed.
To study the cerebral protective effects of hypothermia in arterial hypoxia, anesthetized (70% N2O), mechanically ventilated rats were cooled to a body temperature of 27 C. Hypoxia was induced by decreasing the oxygen content in the inspired gas mixture either to 6-7 per cent or to 2.5-3 per cent.
This reduced mean PaO2 to about 25 and 11-12 torr, respectively.
At PaO2 torr, there was no change in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebrla oxygen consumption (CMRO2), or labile tissue metabolites.
The absence of signs of cerebral hypoxia could be attributed to an effect of temperature and pH on the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve.
Thus, at 27 C with a PaO2 of 25 torr the total oxygen content (TO2) of arterial blood remained greater than 15 ml (100 ml)-1, about three times the value obtained at this PO2 in normothermic rats.
At PaO2 11-12 torr, arterial TO2 was reduced to about 5 ml (100 ml) (-1).
The hypoxia induced no change in CMRO2, a threefold increase in CBF, a moderate lactacidosis in the tissue, and a small decrease in phosphocreatine content, but no change in ATP, ADP, or AMP.
These changes are less marked than those occurring at the same arterial TO2 in normothermic rats.
It is concluded that hypothermia exerts a pronounced protective effect on the brain in hypoxic hypoxia, and that two mechanisms are involved.
First, since hypothermia shifts the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve towards the left, and prevents or minimizes a rightward shift due to acidosis, it maintains a high TO2 in arterial blood at a given PaO2.
Second, by reducing CMRO2, and thereby presumably also cellular energy requirements, hypothermia exerts a protective effect at the cellular level.
A virus, which was isolated from kids (Capra hircus) affected with a relatively severe generalized infection, was found to contain DNA and to have a buoyant density of 1.2820 g/cm3.
The virus was sensitive to the action of lipid solvents and trypsin and was rapidly inactivated at pH 3.0 and at temperatures of 50 and 56 C. The virion, an icosahedron consisting of a nucleoid surrounded by a double membrane, measured approximately 135 nm in diameter.
On the basis of its chemical and physical properties, the virus is considered a herpesvirus.
The rates at which pentobarbital, salicylate, antipyrine, and quinine were transferred from the rumen of intact, conscious goats were measured.
The rates at which the same drugs diffused from the blood plasma (under conditions of constant drug concentration) into the ruminal solution were also evaluated.
These compounds were absorbed by simple diffusion, and the rates of transfer were a function of pH of the intraruminal solution.
The diffusion of drugs from plasma into the reticulorumen allowed steady-state distributions to be established in some goats.
There were good correlations for pentobarbital and antipyrine, but not for salicylate and quinine.
These findings confirm in vivo the general principles of drug transfer across ruminal epithelium that were derived from previous studies conducted in vitro.
To determine the role of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in pneumococcal pneumonia, hemodynamic measurements were made in 16 dogs before, and within 36 hours after, intrapulmonary administration of type III pneumococcus.
Ten dogs with one lobe or more of pneumonia increased their pulmonary vascular resistances and slightly decreased their arterial O2 tensions.
Hypoxia increased and hyperoxia decreased their pulmonary vascular resistances.
During O2 breathing, arterial PO2 was less during than before the pneumonia and increased when pulmonary perfusion was diverted away from the diseased lung.
In 2 dogs breathing air, forcing the cardiac output through the diseased lung caused an increase in vascular resistance that could clearly be reduced by O2 breathing.
In 5 dogs, lung mast cell counts showed no decrease in the lobes with pneumonia.
In pneumococcal pneumonia, the hypoxic pulmonary pressor mechanism serves to decrease blood flow to the diseased lobes and, thus, to maintain the arterial PO2.
Lung mast cells could participate in this response.
A comparative study of blood gases and acid-base parameters, obtained simultaneously from arterial and finger capillary samples, was performed in 45 patients in acute respiratory distress without circulatory shock.
Although small and significant differences were found between the 2 sample pH, Po2, Pco2, and bicarbonate values, the correlations between the 2 were greater than or equal to 0.97 for each variable.
It was concluded that although the arterial blood is the preferred sample for evaluation of blood gases and acid-base status of patients in acute respiratory distress, capillary blood appears to be a valid substitute in the management of these patients.
This technique is particularly valuable in pediatric practice, where repeated arterial samples are less easily obtained.
Bone marrow transplantation is emerging as a viable therapeutic approach to a number of diseases that are usually or uniformly fatal.
We review here recent experiences in bone marrow transplantation in man at UCLA and in various other institutions throughout the world.
We examine marrow transplantation in immunodeficiency diseases, acute leukemia, and aplastic anemia and consider the problems of infection in the transplant recipients.
The applications of tissue typing to marrow transplantation and immunologic manipulations, which may influence engraftment and graft-versus-host disease, are also reported.
Type-C viruses are currently the prime etiologic candidates in systemic lupus erythematosus.
On the basis of knowledge gained from studies of experimental and human models of chronic viral disease, there are possible pathogenetic roles of a virus in systemic lupus erythematosus.
Experimental attempts at implicating specific viruses have been predominantly negative, but evidence for enhanced type-C-virus expression has recently been reported.
A system for measuring the rate of transport of dehydroascorbate into human red blood cells shows Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with substrate inhibition at levels above 150 muM DHA.
The addition of sugars impairs this transport in the diminishing hierarchy D-glucose, D-mannose, D-xylose, D-galactose, L-lyxose, D-araboascorbate, L-sorbose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose.
The effect of glucose on transport of ascorbate is marked at physiological levels.
Transport of DHA is accelerated by copper ion and allows dehydroascorbate to move against a concentration gradient.
The evidence supports the hypotheses proposing that hyperglycemia will impair the intracellular availability of vitamin C.
The levels of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthetase in various rat tissues including those undergoing differentiation or regeneration revealed that the enzyme is related to tissue proliferation and differentiation.
In the liver upon neoplastic transformation, the level of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase rises and the liver form of the enzyme having a pI at 5.0 is replaced by a form with a pI of 4.1.
Since the latter form has also been found present in whole embryos (12- and 14-day) and brain, the molecular alterations of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthetase in liver neoplasia can be considered to be carcinofetal.
It was found that a human hepatoma-associated ALP (orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, E.C.
3.1.3.1) shared electrophoretic mobility, inactivation by urea, inhibition by inorganic phosphate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and amino acids (L-phenylalanine, L-leucine and L-homoarginine), heat stability, sensitivity to neuraminidase, pH optimum, Km value, and antigen site with fast moving ALP isozymes of FL cell strain derived from human amniotic membrane.
The other ALP isozyme of FL cells had properties common to hepatoma ALP with regard to L-phenylalanine sensitivity, inhibition by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, inactivation by urea, and antigen site, but differed from it in electrophoretic mobility, sensitivity to L-leucine and L-homoarginine, and the presence of another antigen site.
It was more heat stable and more sensitive to inhibition by inorganic phosphate than Hepatoma AP.
The possible regulatory mechanism between the hepatoma-type ALP and the placental type ALP in the amnion cells is considered.
The sites of ischaemic injury within the kidney are reviewed and the diagnostic value of measurements of plasma and urinary enzymes in renal ischaemic injury and in renal homotransplant rejection in experimental animals and man is examined.
Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) is an enzyme primarily located in the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney.
Its unique localization in the cells most easily damaged by ischaemia and its ease of assay provide the rationale for its use in the measurement and diagnosis of renal ischaemic injury.
gamma-GT activity was measured in dogs undergoing varying periods of renal ischaemia and under conditions of local renal hypothermia and was shown to be a sensitive indicator of ischaemic injury.
Twenty consecutive patients undergoing renal homotransplantation were studied by daily estimation of their 24-h urinary gamma-GT activity; excellent correlation was obtained between raised levels of this enzyme and the clinical diagnosis of transplant rejection.
The effect of pH on the thermal inactivation of staphylococcal enterotoxin A was investigated.
Analysis of heated toxin by immunodiffusion in gel indicated that enterotoxin A in beef bouillon was inactivated faster at pH 5.3 than at pH 6.2.
The z values (slopes) for the heat inactivation curves at pH 6.2 and 5.3 were 49.5 and 55 F (about 27 and 30 C), respectively.
Enterotoxin produced and heated in dialyzed Casamino Acids medium and assayed by monkey feeding was more easily inactivated by heat at pH 5.3 than at pH 7.8.
Thermal inactivation curves for enterotoxin A in beef bouillon (5 mug/ml, pH 5.3) were determined by two methods, monkey feeding and serological assay.
Survival of salmonellae in artificially contaminated beef-pork mixtures (approximately 10(4) salmonellae/g) was studied in pepperoni prepared by either a natural flora or lactic starter culture fermentation or in nonfermented sausages.
The pepperoni did not become salmonellae free during the usual commercial 15 to 30-day drying period.
Salmonella dublin was present in all products, fermented or unfermented, after 42 to 43 days of drying.
At a lower level of contamination, 10(3)/g, S. dublin could not be recovered from starter culture-fermented pepperoni after 14 days of drying but persisted in the natural flora-fermented sausage.
S. typhimurium (initial count, 10(4)/g) was absent after 42 days of drying when starter culture was used to ferment the pepperoni, but was still present in the natural flora-fermented and unfermented products.
Heating salmonellae contaminated beef-pork pepperoni (after fermantation but before drying) to an internal temperature of 60 C (trichinae inactivating) eliminated the food-borne pathogen from the sausage product.
Conventional and nitrite-free frankfurters in loosely wrapped packages were compared as to their ability to support growth of Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and their naturally occurring spoilage flora at 7 C (simulating refrigerated  storage) and 20 C (simulating possible temperature abuse).
At 7 C Salmonella did not grow in either type of frankfurter; Staphylococcus and the natural spoilage flora sometimes grew more rapidly in the absence of nitrite, but the difference was not significant.
At 20 C growth of Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and of the spoilage flora was, at most, only slightly faster on nitrite-free frankfurters.
Salmonella was not suppressed in broth culture experiments the pH and nitrite content found in frankfurters.
Although either type of frankfurter can become hazardous due to growth of Salmonella or Staphylococcus, no unusual or additional hazard resulted from the omission of nitrite from frankfurters.
An extracellular dextranase (EC 3.2.1.11) was purified approximately 75-fold from cell-free culture filtrates of Fusarium moniliforme.
The purified dextranase was of the endo type, and isomaltose was identified as the primary end product of dextran hydrolysis.
The molecular weight of the dextranase was determined to be 39,000 by gel permeation chromatography.
The enzyme was most active at pH 5.5, and the temperature optimum was near 55 C. Activity was not inhibited by either ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or iodoacetate.
The Km for dextran with an average molecular weight of 10,000 was estimated to be 1.1 X 10(-4) M. The electrophoretic mobility of the dextranase was distinctly different from that of a Penicillium-derived commercial dextranase.
The F. moniliforme dextranase was also found to differ from the commercial preparation by its greater relative activity against glucans isolated from Streptococcus mutans.
Based on their mixotrophic physiology, the isolates are regarded as strains of Thiobacillus perometabolis.
Graft versus host reaction (GvH) following leukocytic transfusions occurred in a 34-year-old man with a generalized lymphosarcoma.
Histologic and ultrastructural studies were performed, with special reference to dyskeratotic cells scattered in the epidermis.
These cells are usually considered to be a constant and important feature of GvH reaction.
These cells could be the result of a toxic damage to the epidermis, provoked by the immunologic phenomenon implicated in GvH reaction.
Later in the clinical course, bullae formations occurred, showing some features of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), as well as features of GvH reaction.
A clinicopathological study of 206 Indian children with nephrotic syndrome showed a primary renal cause in 195 (96%), of which 77% were boys.
In 126 children (96 boys, 30 girls) onset of the disorder occurred before the age of 5 years.
Renal biopsy showed minimal lesions in 150 patients (77%); in 85 of these biopsy was done 3 months to 16 years after onset of the nephrotic syndrome.
Significant renal histological abnormalities in 45 cases were labelled as mesangiocapillary 8, mesangioproliferative 4, proliferative with extensive crescents 2, membranous 3, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 9, focal global glomerulosclerosis 2, advanced nonspecific 8, and mild proliferative 9.
Nephritic manifestations were mainly associated with significant renal lesions, which were more frequently encountered when the onset of disease was after the age of 5 years.
Clearance of proteinuria with corticosteroid therapy was practically confined to patients with minimal or mild renal histological changes.
Our findings suggest that the pattern of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in Indian children is similar to that reported from Western countries.
Normal stratum corneum and psoriatic scales were homogenized and a differential centrifugation was performed.
The DNase activity of the individual fractions was investigated by micro-dis-electrophoresis.
At pH 5 only in the 600xg pellet and 105.000xg supernatant of normal keratin DNase activity could be observed.
However, all psoriatic fractions showed distinct enzyme activities.
At pH 7.4 little psoriatic DNase activity could only be demonstrated in the 105.000xg supernatant.
Except from the 15.000xg pellet all fractions of normal stratum corneum displayed marked activities.
The subcellular distribution of phosphatases, proteinases, and ribonucleases of normal human stratum corneum and psoriatic scales was determined after differential centrifugation.
All psoriatic enzymes showed much increased activities as compared to the normal stratum corneum enzymes.
The highest activities of alkaline phosphatase from psoriatic scales could be detected in the nuclear fraction.
The main activities of all other tested phosphatases and proteinases were present in the cytoplasmatic fraction.
The subcellular distribution of the ribonucleases varied according to the pH value.
An attempt was made to determine the sites of chloroplast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase transcription and translation.
Inhibitors of bacterial RNA and protein synthesis were added to logarithmic and stationary phase cultures of Euglena gracilis wild-type B. Logarithmic phase cultures were sensitive to both types of inhibitors.
In stationary phase cultures plastid synthetase was reduced by RNA but not by protein synthesis inhibitors.
The effect of the antibiotics on the mitochondrial enzyme was also noted.
Rectal temperature, respiratory rate, arterial and venous pH and arterial and venous pCO2 were recorded at intervals of 15-30 minutes in female broiler rabbits exposed an environmental temperature of 35 degrees C, until they died.
Respiratory rate and blood pH rose, and pCO2 fell, until a rectal temperature of 42 degrees C was reached.
Upon further increase in rectal temperature the respiratory rate and pH began to fall, while pCO2 began to rise.
The rabbits died when rectal temperature reached 43 degrees C. Features of respiratory function peculiar to the rabbit were discussed.
Phenothiazine-induced bone marrow depression (BMD) was evaluated in three separate but complementary data bases: (1) Among 1,048 patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals, there was no evidence of subclinical depression of the white blood cell (WBC) count attributable to phenothiazines used before admission.
(2) Among 18,587 medical inpatients, there were 34 patients admitted for BMD in the absence of neoplasia or prior cytotoxic drug therapy; one of the latter reported using chlorpromazine hydrochloride, but it is doubtful whether this drug was the cause of the BMD.
(3) Among 24,795 medical, surgical, and gynecological patients surveyed over a ten-month period in 1972, there were four who were admitted for BMD; one of the latter had a reversible leukopenia attributed to trifluoperazine hydrochloride.
Tumour peracidity in otherwise moderately hyperacidulated tumours or tumour regions of DS carcinosarcoma-bearing Wistar rats attained by glucose infusion was substantially increased by simultaneous infusion of amygdalin and intratumoral i.m.
Here the pH value of healthy tissue, measured at the sceletal muscle, remained unchanged.
By means of the said process, tumour hyperacidulation has been raised to a level of deltapH =0.97; attaining a pH difference between tumourous and normal tissue of up to deltapH = 1.6.
In one case, the slope of pH reduction in the tumour increased to 870%.
Moreover, combined administration of glucose, amygdalin and beta-glucosidase evoked a significant cancerostatic effect hypogenesis, tumour regression) being comparable with the action of an Ifosfamid dosage of 150 mg-kg-1.
application of beta-glucosidase under narcosis results in an overall process that still remains somewhat too toxic.
In a double-blind triple cross-over clinical study, 37 patients were exposed to several formulations of mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon Cream) and their pain responses were recorded and converted to a semiquantitative pain index.
The 11.2% concentration in cream was two to three times more painful than the 5% concentration.
Hypertonicity  and not the pH level appears to be the cause of the pain produced by the high (11.2%) concentration.
Parenteral nutrition via central venous catheterization is associated with serious risks, especially that of sepsis.
Lipid emulsion (Intralipid[Sweden]), which may be administered peripherally, was evaluated for its potential to support microbial growth.
Washed cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and three species of Gram-negative rods were all capable of multiplying in the emulsion at room temperature.
Variations in inoculum size did not affect the growth rate.
Studies comparing the emulsion to amino acid-glucose solutions (total parenteral nutrition [TPN])confirmed other reports that TPN inhibits the growth of certain bacteria but merely retards fungal multiplication.
When human serum was added to the lipid emulsion in an attempt to simulate in vivo conditions at the catheter tip, Escherichia coli was inhibited while the growth of S aureus and C albicians was unaltered.
Propoxyphene and its major metabolite norpropoxyphene have been determined in blood and liver in 29 cases of death in which propoxyphene, either as the hydrochloride or as the napsylate salt, was involved.
The use of propoxyphene napsylate (Darvon-N) contributed to the deaths of 4 persons, 3 of whom were former heroin addicts receiving large amounts of this drug in connection with propoxyphene substitution programs.
In the majority of cases the norpropoxyphene blood concentrations exceed the propoxyphene concentrations, although brain determinations in several instances indicate that norpropoxyphene does not cross the blood-brain barrier with the same ease as propoxyphene.
On the basis of the comparative toxicities of propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene in animals and the high tissue concentrations of norporpoxyphene in man after propoxyphene administration, it is conceivable that norpropoxyphene contributes to the toxic effects of propoxyphene.
It was established that intracerebral introduction of 10 min parental cells of the spleen brought about in hybrids (CBAXC57Bl/6) F1 infiltrative-destructive changes (development of lymphocytic infiltrations, dystrophy in the nerve cells, myelin fibres and neurogliacytes) the intensity of which was found to be considerably higher in cases of injection of parental spleen cells from specifically sensitized donors.
Spleen cells of mice CBA produced much greater changes as compared with those produced by spleen cells of mice C57Bl/6.
Inoculation into the mice brain of 10 mln of spleen cells together with tumour in a dose of 1500 cells produced a clear cut inhibitory effect on the tumour growth, this effect being more pronounced following introduction of sensitized cells of the spleen of mice CBA.
A variant of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), Austin disease, is characterized by a multiple isozyme deficiency of arylsulfatase.
A 3 1/2-year-old girl with progressive mental and physical deterioration had decreased activities of arylsulfatases A and B in the leukocytes, shown by acylamide gel electrophoresis.
Under the electron microscope, biopsy specimens of the brain and the peripheral nerve showed lamellar structures with socalled zebra bodies in the cytoplasmic processes of glial cells, granulo-membranous inclusions with fingerprint configurations in neurons, and myelinlike material in Schwann cells.
Results from our study suggest an intricate nature of this dysmetabolic disorder, which shows ultrastructural changes usually seen in classic MLD, a deficiency of arylsulfatase A only, concomitant with those seen in mucopolysaccharidoses such as Hurler and Sanfilippo syndromes.
pH, PaCO2, PaO2, standard bicarbonate, base excess and reduced pH were measured in sheep before and at regular intervals after administration of ketamine with and without atropine and acepromazine premedication.
A decrease in pH and PaO2 and a rise in PaCO2 was observed 15 minutes after administration of ketamine.
Administration of atropine with and without acepromazine had no significant effect on pH, PaCO2 and PaO2.
The values for standard bicarbonate, base excess and reduced pH were not significantly affected.
This indicates that minor changes observed in pH, PaCO2 after ketamine administration are compensated for by the healthy animal's blood buffer system.
One inbred mouse strain, C57BL/Kl, has high galactosidase activities in all tissues while another strain, DBA/2/Kl, has low activities determined by the Bgs locus.
Beta-Galactosidase from these two strains was partly purified by a five-step procedure: acidification, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration at two pHs, and isoelectric focusing.
They had identical heat inactivation curves, pH optima, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, and the Km values were very similar.
Eight different isoenzymes were separated from liver, kidney, and spleen.
Each isoenzyme has a different electrophoretic mobility and there is a stepwise increase in molecular weight from 143,000 to 380,000 beginning with the protein having the lowest isoelectric point.
A likely interpretation is that the isoenzymes bind a smaller polypeptide in varying numbers in addition to the enzymatic polypeptide per se.
Cell-associated Marek's disease (MD) vaccine was suspended at dilutions normally used for vaccination in seven commercially available diluents and in tryptose phosphate broth.
The stability of diluted vaccines was determined by assay in cell cultures subjected to 0 to 37 C for 0 to 90 minutes.
Optimum holding temperatures for MD vaccine virus survival varied with the specific diluents employed.
Some diluents afforded greatest survival when dilution was at 0 C and held at 0 C, while others performed best when dilution was at 25 C followed by cooling and holding at 0 C. Diluents which allowed greatest survival when tested at 37 C also performed well under other temperature regimes.
Spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate and various buffering compounds were added to commercial diluents used for diluting MD vaccine.
Additives producing osmolality of 745 mOsm/kg and higher markedly reduced vaccine virus survival.
The adverse effects of high osmotic pressure were accentuated by extended holding time, elevated incubation temperature, and physical manipulations including mechanical mixing or expressing through a syringe and needle.
Satisfactory MD vaccine virus survival was afforded by a commercial diluent especially formulated to accommodate the pH osmolality changes produced by adding spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate.
