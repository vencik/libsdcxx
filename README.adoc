C++ Implementation of Sørensen–Dice Coefficient Based String Similarity
=======================================================================


Disclaimer
----------

*This is work in progress.*


List of features
----------------

* Bigram multi-set objects implemented as sorted lists of character tuples with count
* Union operation has O(m+n) time complexity (sum of multi-sets' cardinalities at most)
* Intersection doesn't produce objects; only its size is calculated in O(m+n) time
* Python v3 binding is provided (as `pysdc` module, packaged)


Build and installation
----------------------

You need C\++ compiler with support for at least C++14.
Recent enough gcc (v8.3) or newer is OK.
You also need `cmake` and `make`.
For the Python package build, you shall also need `pip3` and Python `distutils`
and `wheel` package.
If you wish to run Python UTs (which is highly recommended), you'll also need `pytest`.

On Debian-based systems, the following should get the above:
----
# apt-get install g++ cmake make git python3-pip python3-distutils
$ pip3 install wheel pytest
----

Clone the project:
----
$ git clone https://github.com/vencik/libsdcxx.git
----

Build the project, run UTs and build Python package:
----
$ cd libsdcxx
$ ./build.sh
----

Note that the `build.sh` script has options; run `$ ./build.sh -h` to see them.
